<p>Stithians is situate in the hundred of Kerrier, and hath

Peran-well, south Mabe.</p>

<p>I take it to be the same place taxed in the Domesday
Book 1087, by the corrupt name of Stachenue.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> At the
time of the first inquisition into the value of Cornish Benefices
this church was not endowed if extant, nor its daughter
church Peranwell; but in Wolsey’s Inquisition 1521,
it was rated by the name of Stedians, £14. 0<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> The
patronage formerly, as I am informed, either in the rector
and fellows of the College of Regular Priests at Glasnith,
or the Governor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s Hospital at Sithney, now in
Boscawen; the incumbent &mdash;&mdash; Hillman, and the
parish rated to the four shillings per pound Land Tax, for
one year 1696, £104. 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 0<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>; the rectory in &mdash;&mdash;
Boscawen.</p>

<p>This church is dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas à Beckett, and
accordingly their parish festival is kept on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s
<!--006.png--><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
Day, July 7th, as was its superior collegiate church of
Glasnith, founded by Walter Branscomb, Bishop of Exeter,
A. D. 1256.</p>

<p>The barton and manor of Penalmicke, id est, the head or
chief coat of mail armour, so called for that such armour
was made or lodged in this place in former ages by the
possessors or proprietors thereof; which place gave name
and original to an old family of gentlemen from thence
surnamed de Penalmick; from whose heirs it passed to
Skewish, tempore Queen Mary, of whose posterity Collan
Skewish, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> tempore <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> sold the same to Sir
Nicholas Hals of Fentongollan, knight, whose son John
Hals, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> sold the same to Pendarves, now in possession
thereof as I am informed.</p>

<p>Tretheage, alias Tredeage, in this parish, is the dwelling
of John Morton, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> that married &mdash;&mdash; Wilton.</p>

<p>On the south-west part of this parish towards Gwendron,
near the highway, are still to be seen nine stones perpendicularly
erected in the earth, in a direct manner, called
the Nine Maids or Sisters, probably set up there in memory
of nine religious sisters or nuns in that place, before the
fifth century (See <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb Major and Buryan); not
women turned into stones as the English name implies, and
as the country people thereabout will tell you. See also
Gwendron.</p>

<p>This parish is enriched with streams and lodes of tin in
abundance.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Stithians is in the hundred of Kerrier, and hath to the
west Gwendron, to the north Gwenap, to the east <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Piran
Arwothall, and to the south Constanton and Mabe.</p>

<p>This parish takes its name from its guardian saint <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Stithians [rather Stithian. But who was he? W.]</p>

<p>It is a vicarage, valued together with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Piran Arwothall
in the King’s Book [see Piran Arwothall before],
<!--007.png--><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
and hath the same patron, impropriator, and incumbent
with that. I shall begin with the chief estate in it,</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE MANOR OF TRETHEAGE,</p>

<p class="unindent">&mdash;the fair town or dwelling. [The fair house. W.] And
so it may be well called, considering the country it lies in, as
being for that pleasantly situated on the river which runs
under Ponsannowth or New Bridge, and emptieth itself
under Piran Arwothall church. This was formerly a
manor of large extent, but now strangely curtailed.</p>

<p>Of late years it hath been the seat of the family of Morton;
the last of which who lived here, John Morton, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr>
who married &mdash;&mdash; the daughter of John Wilton of
Dunveth, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> was oddly outed of it (169..) by Nicholas
Pearce; who having gotten a great deal of money in Magdalen
Ball in Gluvias, settled it on his son Nicholas Pearce,
lately dead, leaving by &mdash;&mdash; his wife, the daughter of
&mdash;&mdash; Trewren, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Trewardreva, one son Nicholas
Pearce, a minor, who is the present lord of this manor.
Morton’s arms were, Argent, a chevron between three
moorcocks Sable.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church and tower of this parish are handsome objects
built of granite, which abounds throughout all that
district.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives, as usual, on account of the ancient
manors. The manor of Kennal, he says, belonged in the
reign of Edward the Second to Matthew Penfern, afterwards
to the Carminows, one of whose coheiresses brought
it to the Arundells of Lanherne; by whom, in the year 1800,
it was sold to three brothers of the name of Bath, who are
the present proprietors. The manor of Roseeth is the
property of Thomas Hocker, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> the devisee of Thomas
Reed, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> The barton of Tretheage is the residence of
<!--008.png--><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
Mrs. Curgenven, widow of the late proprietor, Captain
Curgenven, of the Royal Navy. The barton of Penalurick
belongs to Mr. Hocker, and Stephen Ustick, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> The
bartons of Treweek and Tresavren belonged to the family
of Hawes, but now to Mr. James Brown.</p>

<p>Tretheage, situated near the turnpike road leading from
Truro to Helston, has a very pleasing appearance in the
midst of a country almost bare of trees. About fifty or
sixty years ago this place was the residence of a gentleman
called Tincombe, who had been a practitioner of medicine,
but retired to Tretheage, where either he or his father had
built the present house. He married a Miss Kniverton
of Tredreath in Lelant, but died without children.</p>

<p>Trevales has been for many years the residence of the
late Mr. Thomas Reed, and of his ancestors; who having
been long what is termed good livers in the parish, advanced
themselves by successful adventures in mines, and by conducting
a tin smelting house in the parish of Perran
Arworthall. Mr. Thomas Reed never married, and devised
the greater part of his property to Mr. Hocker his
near relation.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, the church of Stithians was given by
Edward the Black Prince, to the abbey of Rewley near
Oxford, in exchange for the manor of Nettlebed. It
appears from the printed documents relative to that abbey,
that Edmund Earl of Cornwall, in pursuance of his father’s
direction, Richard King of the Romans, founded Rewley
Abbey in the year 1280.</p>

<p>His charter, inter alia, has these words:</p>

<p>With the exception of a small patch on its eastern
extremity, this parish is situated entirely on granite, affording
varieties similar to those of Gwennap, Redruth, Camborne,
and Crowan, all of which are intersected by beds of
porphyry, called by the miners elvan courses. The slate
which occurs on the eastern side of this parish is felspathic,
resembling that of the adjoining parish of Gwennap.</p>

<p>Stoke Climsland is situate in the hundred of East, and
hath upon the north Lezant, west Southill, east Calstock
and the Tamar River, south Killington.</p>

<p>This parish and church take their name from the manor
of Stow Climsland in this parish aforesaid, and by that
name it was taxed in the Domesday Book 1087. It was
first given by Orgar Duke of Devon, or Elphrida his lady,
to Tavistock Abbey in Devon, which he had founded.
(Dugdale’s Monasticon Anglicanum, page 360.) Afterwards
it became the possession of the Kings of England or
Earls of Cornwall, and was by King Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> incorporated
into the Duchy of Cornwall 1336. (See the charter
under Lestwithiel.) And to remove an action at law out
of the Court Leet of this Duchy or Stannary Manor, or
any other in Devon, as I have elsewhere noted under Helleston,
the writ must be thus directed:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of Hengiston Downs, King Egbright’s victory, and tin
works in this parish, I have spoken under Killington.
And of this manor of Climsland, and the park of Cari
Bollock in this parish are mention made in the Duke’s
Charter aforesaid. Now the modern name Cary-Bollock,
I take to be only a corruption of Carow-Bollogk, female
deer of a stag, probably kept here in the Duke’s park, when
brought out of the forest of Dartmoor.</p>

<p>It appears from the ancient Survey of the Duchy of
Cornwall in the Exchequer, tempore Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> (and

that the old tenure of this Duchy Manor of Climsland or
Clemsland, was villanage.</p>

<p>The manor of Rillaton in this parish, was invested with
the jurisdiction of a Court Leet, and is annexed to the
Duchy of Stoke Climsland, with all its privileges, as I am
imformed. To remove an action at law from which, the

manors belonging to the Duke of Cornwall, and so settled
by Edward the Third on his son Edward the Black Prince
in the eleventh year of his reign, I shall say no more of
it here, but come to the most remarkable places in it; and
first to</p>

<p class="p2 center small">CARY BULLOCK PARK.</p>

<p>So Mr. Carew calls it (<abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 115), “Carybullock,” saith
he “some time a parke of the Duke’s, but best brooking
that name now it hath lost its qualitie, through exchanging
deere for bullocks.” Sir John Dodridge (History of Wal.
and Corn. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 84, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>) calls it Kerry-bollock; but what if I
should say the right name was Caer-bollick, and did signify
the intrenched inclosure on the river?&mdash;the situation
would exactly answer this derivation; but, since the writing
of this, I find (Salmon’s Survey of England, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 714) that Mr. Baxter, in Bullœum or Buelt (according
to Mr. Camden) in Brecknockshire, interprets it to be
Caer-Bulack or “Principis Domus,” the Prince’s town or
inclosure, which (if true) would suit very well with this.
[This is a judicious application of one of Mr. Baxter’s
etymons to the present place; Bulœum, as Baxter says
the name is written in the superior copies of Ptolemy’s
Geography, Baxter thinks with Lhwyd to be the modern
Caer Phylli. Bel, he says, is properly a head, and figuratively
a king. This makes Caer Bulack, “quod ara est
Regia.” “Certe,” he adds, very usefully, “vel ipsi novimus
in Montegomerica nostra Regione Domunculam antiqua
Rhesi filii Theodori progenie nobilem;” ennobled by
the birth of Rhys ap Tudor, “vel hodie nominatam Caer
Bulach, tanquam Principis dicatur domus.” In proof of
Mr. Baxter’s seemingly unfounded interpretation of Bel,
Bol, or Bul, a head and a king, we may observe the
name of the sun Beal, in the Beal-tine of Cornwall and
the Beil-tine of Ireland for the fires on May-day in

honour of the sun; Beal, Bil (I.) a mouth; Bil (W.) the
mouth of the vessel; Bollog (I.) a shell, a scull, the top of
the head; Fal (I.) a king or great personage; Folar (I.)
to command; Folarthoir (I.) an emperor; Folladh (I.)
government; Ffelaig (W.) a general, a captain, a leader;
Belee, plural Belein (C.) a priest or priests; Belek (A.) a
priest; Pol-kil (C.) the hinder part of the head or the top
of the neck; and in Belinus, Cunobelinus, and the promontory
Bolerium of the ancient Britons; and Caer-Bulack,
as a royal house is called equally in Wales, would in
the Cornish mode of pronunciation be Cerry-bullock, as
Car-hayes is Carry-hayes at present. W.]</p>

<p>Which since its being disparked by King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
has been set out at lease to several gentlemen, and is now

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons enumerates the manors; the principal of
which are the manor giving its name to the parish, part of
the ancient possessions of the duchy of Cornwall, and the
manor of Climsland Prior, extending into Linkinhorne,
which formerly belonged to the priory of Launceston; and
after the general dissolution was given with many other
manors forming the modern duchy in exchange for the
honour and castle of Wallingford.</p>

<p>Carrybullock, disparked by King Henry the Eighth, was
held under a lease from the duchy by Mr. Weston Helyar.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons mentions other manors and bartons of no
general interest, with the exception of Whiteford, on account
of its late proprietor.</p>

<p>Mr. John Call was one of those individuals of whom the
country adjacent to the Tamar may be proud.</p>

<p>It is understood that he was born on the Devonshire side
of the river, and various tales are related of his first advancement
in life; these are usually little worthy of attention,
<!--014.png--><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
and are most frequently exaggerated from an innate
love of the marvellous. Mr. Call having proceeded to
India as an engineer, most eminently distinguished himself
in that field, more ample than any recorded in history for
the successful display of abilities, and active persevering
industry; and where, for the first time since distinct nations
have been brought into contact by the improvements of
navigation and of commerce, the vanquished have become
debtors to the more successful party for protection, for the
administration of equal laws and of impartial justice, and
for the introduction among the inhabitants of the spirit of
honour, the glory of modern Europe.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Call having served his country, and justly
acquired the legitimate rewards of fame and of ample
fortune, retired to his native country, purchased Whiteford,
which he converted into a handsome seat, and much other
property in the neighbourhood. His active mind could
not, however, remain unemployed; he became a banker, a
manufacturer of plate-glass, and a copper smelter. He
served the office of Sheriff for Cornwall in the year 1771;
afterwards represented Callington in Parliament, and was
finally created a Baronet.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to insert some miscellaneous information
which the gentleman communicated to this Editor
in Oct. 1798, while he resided for a few weeks or
months at Marazion, and which was imperfectly noted at
the time.</p>

<p>He received the whole of his education as an engineer
under Mr. Benjamin Robins, <abbr title="Fellow of the Royal Society">F.R.S.</abbr> Engineer-General to
the East India Company, the well-known author of various
mathematical tracts, and especially of a treatise on the
principles of gunnery, the force of gunpowder, and on the
resisting power of the air to bodies in swift and in slow
motion. This treatise his pupil Mr. Call transcribed for
the press; and no doubt he assisted in making those admirable
experiments and mathematical deductions from them,
which have given a new character to this important branch
<!--015.png--><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
of military science, as well in respect to small arms, and
more especially to rifled barrels, as to cannon and mortars,
in reference to which Mr. Call made an additional improvement
so as to discharge shells from long guns by
placing the fusee internally, with its orifice concentric to
the surface instead of projecting, and thereby securing it
from injury as the shot rolls in passing out of the gun.</p>

<p>He successfully defended Fort <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George at Madras;
and in 1761 conducted the siege of Pondicherry, which
ended in the capture of that place, the chief seat of the
French power in India. Sir John Call also mentions as a
curious circumstance, illustrative of the decisive effects produced
by the well-directed fire of field artillery, that in a
battle where he was present (query, was it Plassey?) a
shell from an howitzer caused the explosion of a carriage
containing gunpowder, which produced some confusion
and disorder in the enemy’s line; the commander instantly
ordered a charge, and the victory was decided.</p>

<p>And he related another anecdote on a very different subject.
That having with other amateurs of astronomy made
preparations for observing the transit of Venus by constructing
a temporary observatory on the flat roof of the
government house at Madras, they waited with impatience
after a long continuance of fine weather, for the important
<abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of June 1761, when a most violent storm on the preceding
night injured or destroyed their instruments so as
to render any observation impossible; and, what added to
their mortification and disappointment, a long continuance
of fine weather succeeded this tempest.</p>

<p>Whiteford is now the residence of his son Sir William
Pratt Call, who was Sheriff of Cornwall in 1807, and has
a family.</p>

<p>The southern part of this parish includes the whole of
the granite of Kit Hill, which is for the most part of the
coarse-grained crystalline variety so common in Cornwall.
Proceeding northward, the rest of the parish is found to
belong to the schistose rocks; those next to the granite
are felspathic, and contain beds of porphyry, but those
more remote, which form the greater part, must be referred

<p>Stratton is now situate in the hundred from thence
denominated Stratton, (formerly Major Trigshire Cantred)

for the name, after the Saxon, it is compounded of Strat-ton,

perhaps from the Latin strata, a street or Roman highway;
and by this name of Stratton, it is taxed in the Domesday
Book 1087. In the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln
and Winchester aforesaid 1294, Ecclesia de Stratone, in

weekly market on Tuesdays, and Fairs annually on the 8th
of May, 28th of October, and 30th of November.</p>

<p>Thurlebere, Thurle-ber, bir, in this parish, was another
district taxed in the Domesday Book 1087, from whence
was denominated an ancient family of gentlemen surnamed
De Thurlebere, or whurle-ber; i. e. cast, whirle, twine,
the spit, short spear, dart, pike, lance or broach, for so the
terminative particle ber, bere, bir, indifferently signifies.
See Floyd upon Obelus. In this place John de Thurlebere
held by the tenure of knight’s service, twenty pounds
per annum in lands, tempore Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> and John de
Cobham had likewise in it by the same tenure the third
part of a knight’s fee. (Survey of Cornwall, page 40 and
52.) One of those Thurleberes married the daughter and
heir of Thomas de Waunford, Lord of Ebbingford, alias
Efford in Bude Bay, and afterwards made it the place of
their residence, tempore Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> till at length the daughter
and heir of those Thurleberes was married to Arundell
of Trerice, tempore Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> whose posterity are now
in possession thereof.</p>

<p>Near this town of Stratton, in a field called &mdash;&mdash;
there happened on Tuesday the 16th of May
1643, a sore and bloody battle between the army or soldiers
of King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> under conduct of his general Sir Ralph
Hopton, knight, and Major-General Chudleigh, Commander
of the Parliament Forces in those parts; where,
after a sharp contest from five of the clock in the morning
till three in the afternoon, the fight or success continued
doubtful: so that Sir Bevill Grenvill, knight, was unhorsed,
and his troop put into disorder by Chudleigh’s men; and
<!--018.png--><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
the king’s party had been totally overthrown had not Sir
John Berkeley with great courage and conduct led up the
musketeers he commanded to their seasonable assistance,
maintaining the charge with that stoutness, that the Parliament
army, after the loss of about three hundred soldiers,
gave ground, and Chudleigh was taken prisoner, with seventeen
hundred more of his party. The king’s army having
sustained the loss of about two hundred persons, had the
plunder of the field, wherein they found seventeen brass
pieces of ordinance, seventy barrels of powder, three thousand
arms, with ammunition, provision, and biscuit, proportionable.</p>

<p>The country people hereabout will tell you, that the
field aforesaid where this battle was fought, being afterwards
tilled to barley, produced sixty bushels of corn, Winchester
measure, in every acre (See <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sennan); the fertility
whereof is ascribed to the virtue the lands received from
the blood of slain men and horses, and the trampling of
their feet in this battle.</p>

<p>For this victory, Sir Ralph Hopton, knight of the
Bath, was by Letters Patent dated at Oxford, 4th September,
19 Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> by him created Baron Hopton of Stratton;
but he dying without issue at Bruges in Flanders,
King Charles the Second, in the 12th year of his reign,
conferred that honorary title of Straton, upon Sir John
Berkeley aforesaid (younger son of Sir Maurice
Barkley of Bruton in Somerset) who also was one of the
four managers of martial affairs in Cornwall for King
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> together with the Lord Mohun, Sir Ralph
Hopton aforesaid, and Colonel Ashburnham; he also
reduced Exeter, and was made governor thereof, and gave
for his arms in a field Ruby a chevron Ermine, between
ten crosses pattee Pearl, six in chief, and four in base.</p>

<p>The ancestor of this Sir Ralph Hopton, knight, came
out of France or Normandy, a soldier or huntsman under
William the Conqueror 1066, by the name of the Norman
<!--019.png--><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
Hunter, to whom he gave Hopton in the Hole in the county
of Salop, (from whence afterwards he was denominated De
Hopton,) which he conveyed to him and his heirs, and
failing the remainder, to the crown.</p>

<p>Sir William de Mohun, one of the founders of the
Abbey of Newham in Devon, 30th Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> gave to the
same the bailiwick of the hundred of Axminster, and also
the manor of Norton, with the hundred and bailiwick of
Major Trigshire, now Stratton in Cornwall. (See Prince’s
Worthies of Devon.) After the dissolution of Newham
Abbey, 26 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> it fell to the crown, from whence
the present titles of those bailiwicks are derived.</p>

bounded to the west by the north or Severn channel and
Poughill, to the north by Kilkhampton, to the east by the
river Tamar, to the south by Lancells, Marhamchurch,

<p>As for the name, it is no other than the street town, from
its consisting chiefly of one street, and being a great

<p>Stratton is a neat although a small town. Before the
great roads were made through the middle of the county
along the central ridge and above the formation of deep
valleys, a northern entrance into Cornwall passed through
this town.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, that the manors of Stratton and
Binomy belonged at an early period to an ancient family
called in various records De Albo Monasterio, or Blanchminster
and Whitminster. The property passed by an
heiress to the family of Hiwis; and Emmeline the heiress
of Hiwis, married first, Sir Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice
of the King’s Bench, who lost his life through popular
violence in the year 1388; and secondly, Sir John Coleshill.</p>

<p>Sir John Coleshill, son of the above, was killed at the
battle of Agincourt in 1415, leaving an infant son; after
whose death in 1483 the large estates of this family passed
by a female heir to a younger branch of the Arundells, and
were afterwards divided among its numerous representatives.</p>

<p>The manors of Binomy and Stratton having been purchased
by the Grenvilles, have descended to Lord Carteret.</p>

<p>The manor of Efford or Ebbingford, belonged at an early
period to the Waumfords or Waunfords, from whom it
passed by a coheiress to the Durants, and from them by an
heiress to the Arundells of Trerice, from whom it is
derived to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland of Killerton.</p>

<p>The church and tower are fine specimens of the style of
architecture prevalent throughout the West of England.
There are also several monuments; and Mr. Lysons quotes
<!--021.png--><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
from the register, the baptism and death of Elizabeth
Cornish, who lived between these two dates, 113 years 4
months and 13 days. She was baptized in Oct. 1578, and
was buried March the 10th, 1691.</p>

<p>The great tithes and the manor denominated Sanctuary,
or Sentery, as was usual with such professions, belonged to
the Priory of Launceston. After the dissolution of monasteries,
this manor carrying with it the advowson of the
vicarage, was annexed to the Duchy of Cornwall, with
various other lands, in exchange for the honour and castle
of Wallingford.</p>

<p>The great tithes were granted to the family of Wadder,
but they have since been sold in parcels.</p>

<p>The place of most importance in this parish after the
town, is Bude. This place has always given some shelter
for boats, and afforded sand for manure. It has within
about twenty years received most essential improvement.
A pier or jetty has been built out into the sea, and a
canal with inclined planes has been made for the conveyance
of coal and merchandise into the country, and for
bringing down slate and the produce of land; but above all,
for supplying sand as a manure. The sand at this place
consists entirely of powdered shells, as it does along the
whole north coast of Cornwall, and it is found to be so
efficacious for imparting fertility to clay lands, that it is
frequently conveyed in wheel carriages to so great a distance
from the coast, as to require the draft cattle remaining
out a night.</p>

<p>The boats used on this coast are formed like boxes,
having within each side a closed trough containing two
wheels, which project a very little beyond the lower surface.
These wheels are consequently no impediment to the boats
floating on the water, but they enable them to ascend or to
descend the inclined planes with the facility of other
carriages. See a Treatise on the Improvement of Canal
Navigation, by R. Fulton, 1 <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 4to, London, 1796, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 32,
where this plan is suggested perhaps for the first time.</p>

<p><!--022.png--><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
Bude is also become a place of resort for sea bathing;
and several houses for the accommodation of strangers have
been built by Sir Thomas Acland, so that it has acquired
the well-known appellation of a watering place.</p>

<p>The Editor having omitted through inadvertence to
notice in the adjoining parish of Launcels a gentleman one of
the most respectable in the north-eastern part of Cornwall,
hopes that he may be excused for inserting his name here.</p>

<p>Launcells House, a modern building on the spot where
formerly stood the residence of the Chamonds, is the seat
of George Boughton Kingdon, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> respected by every one
who has the honour of his acquaintance, for scientific and
literary acquirements, and esteemed as a benefactor to his
neighbourhood in the characters of a magistrate and of a
worthy country gentleman.</p>

<p>An instance of longevity has been given in the parish of
Stratton, and an occurrence has been stated to the Editor,
which proves that Launcells participates in the general
healthiness of that district.</p>

<p>It seems the identical six men who rang the bells in
Launcells tower on the Coronation of King George the
Third, rang them also on the day of his jubilee, having
continued the parish ringers during all that time.</p>

<p>Their names are recorded in the parish, and may therefore
be inserted here.</p>

<p>John Lyle, Henry Cadd, Richard Venning, John Ham,
John Allin, Richard Hayman.</p>

<p>And of these, John Lyle rang at the accession of King
George the Fourth, and of his present Majesty King William
the Fourth, being then in his ninety-sixth year: but
all are now gathered to their fathers.</p>

<p>And here, as appertaining more to the general character
of the country than to any particular parish, in reference to
the terrific cliffs which surround this coast, it may be
proper to state a fact communicated by Mr. Kingdon; that,
from actual measurement taken by himself, Hennacleve
cliff on Westcot Down, in the parish of Moorwinstow, is
430 feet above the level of the beach.</p>

<p>In the Domesday Book 1087, this district was taxed

of Lincoln and Winchester, into the value of Cornish
Benefices, Ecclesia de Talland 1294, was rated at £8.

the four shillings per pound Land Tax 1696, for one year,
£156. 15<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> But if the word Talland be compounded only
of Ta-land, it signifies the good acceptable land.</p>

<p><!--024.png--><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
West Looe, alias Porth-Vyan, Porth-Byan, alias Porth-Bichan
or Porth-Bigan, or Pigan, all synonymous words
in British, only varied by the dialect, which signifies the
little gate, cove, creek, or entrance, according to the natural
circumstances of the place, where daily the sea makes its
flux and reflux some miles up into the land or country,
through a narrow passage betwixt the parishes of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s
and Talland aforesaid, over which is a curious and
strong stone bridge of about twelve arches, which as an
artificial ligament fastens those parishes and the towns of
East and West Looe together; which latter, by the name
of Porth Byhan, was taxed as the voke lands of a privileged
borough or manor in the Domesday Book as aforesaid,
1087, and still known by the name of Porth Byan or West
Looe; and by this name all its privileges were confirmed,
and the town incorporated 16th of Queen Elizabeth, by
the name of the mayor and burgesses thereof, consisting of
a mayor and twelve burgesses.</p>

<p>The members of Parliament are elected by the majority
of freemen; and the precept from the Sheriff, or the writ
for electing those members, as also for removal of an action
at law depending in this court to a superior, must be thus
directed:</p>

<p>Majori et Liberis Burgensibus Burgi sui de Porth
Byan, alias West Looe, in comitatu Cornubiæ, salutem.</p>

<p>And as a further testimony of its present grandeur,
though I take it much inferior in riches and building to
the late erected town of East Looe, it hath ever, and still
stands as a noun substantive in the Exchequer, and was
rated to the four shillings per pound Land Tax for one
year, by the name of the borough of West Looe, £15. 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
1696. Whereas, the borough of Michell falls under the
tax of Newlan and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Enedor parishes; Bosinney or
Trevena under Dundagell; and Camelford under Lantegles,
in the Exchequer, without name or value.</p>

<p>This town is also privileged with a fair yearly, on 25th
April, and markets weekly.</p>

<p>The arms of this borough are, a soldier or man of war
Proper, with a bow in one hand, and an arrow in the
other. For the etymology of Looe, see East Looe.</p>

<p>This manor of borough of Porthbyan, as I am informed,
was heretofore villanage tenure, and pertained to the
Bodrigans.</p>

<p>In this town of West Looe, was born Charles Wager,
as I am informed, son of &mdash;&mdash; Wager; who, being
placed an apprentice at sea, grew so expert in navigation
and the mathematics, that he became a great master in
that art; and being after in the sea fight between Queen
Anne and the French and Spaniards, he behaved himself so
well in his valour and conduct, though to the loss of one of
his arms, that by Queen Anne or King George he was
afterwards knighted, and preferred, not only to the command
of a third-rate frigate, but made Admiral of the Red
Squadron of Men of War, for him and his son King
George the Second, in the Baltic Sea and British Channel
1729.</p>

<p>In this parish stands the barton and manor of Killygarth.
This lordship, tempore Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> was the lands of
the Sergeaulxes, and particularly of Richard de Sergeaulx,
who is mentioned in Mr. Carew’s Survey of Cornwall,
page 52, 25 Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> then to have held in

Cornwall, by the tenure of knight service, £20 per annum
in lands and tenements. His son Sir Richard Sergeaulx,
knight, was Sheriff of Cornwall, 12 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> whose son
Richard Sergeaulx held in Killygarth, Lanreth, and Lansulhas,
three little knight’s fees of land of Morton, as also two
fees and a half in Colquite, (idem librum, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 42,) 3 Henry
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> (five knight’s fees was four thousand acres of land);
who dying without issue male, his three daughters or sisters
became his heirs, and were married to Seyntaubyn and
Beare of Cornwall, and Marney of Essex, as I am informed;
after whose decease, Beare became seised of this lordship,
was married and had issue Thomas Beare, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> Sheriff of
Cornwall, 4th of Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>; and William Beare, Sheriff
of Cornwall, 6th of Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> who gave the bear
for his arms, the colours I know not.</p>

<p>This William Beare had issue only one daughter, married
to Peter Bevill, a younger brother of John Bevill of
Gwarnack, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who had issue by her, John Bevill, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
that married Mileton of Pengersick; who by her had issue
Sir William Bevill, knight, Sheriff of Cornwall, 31st of
Elizabeth 1591, that married &mdash;&mdash;, but had no
legitimate issue: so that his brother Philip’s daughter
Elizabeth became his heir, and was married to Sir Bernard
Grenvill of Stowe, knight, father of Sir Bevill Grenvill,
knight, that sold this lordship of Killygarth to Killygrew,
from whom it passed to Hallet, and from him to Kendall
of Middlesex, now in possession thereof.</p>

<p>The arms of Bevill are Ermine, a bull passant Sable.</p>

<p>Hen-darsike in this parish is a contraction of Hen-dowers-ike,
i. e. old, ancient cove, creek, lake, or bosom of waters,
lands probably under such circumstances. It is the dwelling
of John Morth, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> that married &mdash;&mdash; Buller of Morvall;
his father William Morth was Sheriff of Cornwall 2 William
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></p>

<p>This family in genteel degree hath flourished in this

to the particulars.</p>

<p>Talland is in the hundred of West, and is bounded to
the west by Launcells, to the north by Pelynt, to the east
by Looe river, and to the south by the British Channel.</p>

<p>This is a vicarage, not valued in the King’s Book; but in
anno 1291, 20 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> it was valued, the rectory (<abbr title="Taxio Beneficiorum">Tax.
Benef.</abbr>) at £8, it having been appropriated to Launceston
Priory; and the vicarage at 40<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> The patronage is in
Archdeacon Kendall, and the incumbent Mr. Doidge.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Kendall had a younger brother, Colonel
James Kendall, who was Governor of Barbadoes in &mdash;&mdash;,
one of the lords of the Admiralty under Queen Anne, and
a member of Parliament in several Parliaments: he died
suddenly, unmarried, July the 10th, 1708, at his house in
London, very rich, and left a natural son by Mrs. Colliton,
who now goes by the name of Kendall.</p>

<p>Under Killygarth is Porth-Para, vulgo Polpera, id est,
the sandy port. “A little to the eastwards,” saith
Carew, (<abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 131 b.) “from Killygarth, the poor harbour
and village of Polpera coucheth between two steep hills:”
[from which circumstance, as I know of no word similar to
para in the Cornish, and signifying sand in English, I
might more aptly take the name to be (as Carew writes,
and as usage sounds it) pol-pera, pol-poran, the close
or strait pool. But the fact is, that the name is purely
English, with a Cornish pronunciation. “By est, the
haven of Fowey upon a <abbr title="four">iiii</abbr> miles of,” says Leland, <abbr title="Itinerary">Itin.</abbr>
<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 121), “ys a smawle creke cawled Paul <em>Pier</em>, and a
symple and poore village upon the est side of the same, of

fisharmen, and the bootes ther fishing by [be] saved by a
<em>Peere</em> or key. In the est side of this Paul Pirre,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
And since the cove is still written as Leland first writes it,
“Paul Pier” (See Borlase’s map) so is it obviously allusive
to the “Pier or Key,” which he mentions at it. W.] where
plenty of fish is vented to the fish-drivers, whom we call
“jowters” [men who jolt about with horses and panniers to
sell fish]. And between this and the church is Porth Talland.</p>

<p>The manor by the name of Tallan, in the extent of Cornish
acres, 12 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> is valued in six. (Carew, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 49.)
[Here let me just note what Mr. Tonkin has omitted, the
etymology of the name of the parish, and of the manor.
Written originally Tallan, and gaining only the final <em>T.</em> by
vicious pronunciation, the manor and the parish derive
their name apparently from the church; and this takes its
appellation from its site, I apprehend, being seated upon
the high bold shore of the channel, and so being called
Tal-Lan, the high church or the church upon a high position;
just as Tal-ar (C.) signifies a high land or headland,
and as a high rock in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen is called Tal-Carne. W.] Of
the ancient lords of which manor I shall give a full
account on the other side [see towards the end]; and only
take notice here, that within it, and</p>

<p>Next is the church. Near this the family of Murth hath
long dwelt. “In the same parish where Killingworth is
seated,” saith Carew, (<abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 131), “Master Murth inheriteth
a house and demaynes: hee maried Treffry: his father
Tregose. One of their ancestors, within the memory of a
next neighbour to the house called Prake (burdened with
a hundred and ten yeeres of age), entertained a British
[a Bréton] miller; as that people, for such idle occupations,
prove more handie than our owne. But this fellow’s
service befell commodious in the worst sense. For when,
not long after his acceptance, warres grew between us and
France, he stealeth over into his country, returneth privily

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Bond has given so good and ample an account of
this parish in his Topographical and Historical Sketches of
East and West Looe, 1 <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="octavo">8vo.</abbr> printed by Nichols, 25,
Parliament Street, Westminster, 1823, that the whole
which is addative to Hals and Tonkin, is here inserted.</p>

<p>West Looe is situated in the parish of Talland, within
which parish is a hamlet called Lemain, and part of West
Looe lies in this hamlet. On the barton of Portlooe in
the parish of Talland, just opposite Looe Island, was a cell
of Benedictine Monks, called Lammana, subject to the
Abbey of Glastonbury, to which the site appears to have
been given by the ancestors of Hastulus de Solenny; there
are some remains of the chapel still in existence.</p>

<p>I measured this chapel on the 13th of April 1815, and
found it, within the walls, about forty-seven feet long by
twenty-four wide. About three or four hundred yards to
the eastward of the chapel are the remains of some antient
building, perhaps that in which the monks dwelt. The
remains of the eastern end wall thereof, at present eight or
ten feet high, have two very narrow windows or openings,
still in being. The situation of this chapel and house is
very pleasant; they lie in a sort of natural amphitheatre,
sheltered from the north winds by high land.</p>

<p><!--030.png--><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
In Hearne’s Appendix to Adam de Domerham, is a
grant of Hastulus de Solenny, confirming the Island of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael de Lammana (most probably that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George
opposite Looe) to the Monks of Glastonbury; a grant of
Roger Fitzwilliam quitting claim to the lands of Lammana,
which he held for life under the Church of Glastonbury
(reserving the house which Mabil his sister occupied), and
one of Richard Earl of Cornwall, granting the Monks a
licence to farm out the church, and the Island of Lammana.
It appears that Abbat Michael, about the middle
of the thirteenth century, leased it to the Sacristary of the
Convent. The Free Chapel of La Mayne in Cornwall, was
granted to Edward Bostock, 5th Jac.&mdash;<cite>Lysons’s <abbr title="Magna Britannia">Mag. Brit.</abbr></cite></p>

<p class="p2 center small">MIDMAIN ROCK.&mdash;PORTNADLER BAY.</p>

<p>Between the main land and Looe Island stands a rock,
higher than the surrounding ones, which is called Midmain
or Magmain. Small vessels frequently pass between the
island and the main land, when the tide is in. An imaginary
line drawn from Looe Island westward, to a high rock
called horestone or orestone, about a mile distant, would
form the outer boundary of a piece of water called Portnadler
Bay; from whence the name is derived I know not.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">CORPORATION.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth incorporated West Looe 14th February
1574, in the sixteenth year of her reign, by the name of
Mayor and Burgesses of the Borough of Portbyhan, otherwise
West Looe, in the county of Cornwall. Twelve chief
burgesses were appointed by this charter. The mayor is
elected from the Chief Burgesses, by their votes and the
votes of the Free Burgesses, on Michaelmas-day annually,
between nine and twelve of the clock in the forenoon, and
then sworn into office. The mayor is also a Justice of the
Peace, as is likewise the steward. The mayor has no power
<!--033.png--><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
to appoint a deputy. The steward, however, has such an
authority; but his deputy is not a Justice of the Peace.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">WEST LOOE DOWN.&mdash;GIANT’S HEDGE OR MOUND.</p>

<p>Just above the houses (the intermediate space filled up
with gardens and orchards) is a common or down, called
West Looe Down, of near a hundred acres, on which are
the remains of a mound of earth that runs many miles
across the country, and is noticed by Borlase, who, from
its extent and other circumstances, supposed it to be a
Roman work. His account of it as follows: “That the
Romans had ways in the eastern parts of the county about
Loo and Lostwithiel, the following antient work, shewn
me by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Howell, Rector of Lanreath (June
25 and 26, 1756), will abundantly confirm. It is called
the Giant’s Hedge, a large mound, which reaches from
the valley in which the Boroughs of East and West Looe
are situated, to Leryn, on the river Fowey. It is first
visible on West Looe Down, about two hundred paces
above the Mills; whence it runs to Kilminarth Woods;
from and through them to Trelawn Wood, about three
hundred paces above Trelawn Mill; then through Little
Larnick to the barton of Hall, in which there are two circular
encampments, about four hundred paces to the north
of it; thence quite through the said barton, making the
northern boundary of fields to the glebe of Pelynt Vicarage,
called Furze Park; then cross the barton of Tregarrick;
and thence, through the north grounds of Tresassen and
Polventon, to the glebe lands of the rectory of Lanreath,
where I measured it seven feet high and twenty feet wide
at a medium; thence it stretches through the tenement of
Wyllacombe to Trebant Water; whence it proceeds,
through the barton of Longunnet and some small tenements,
to Leryn; from which there is a fair dry down,
called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow Down, leading north along to Lostwithiel.
This risbank, or mound, ranges up hill and down
<!--034.png--><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
hill indifferently; has no visible ditch continued on any
brow of a hill, as intrenchments always have; there is no
hollow, or foss, on one side more than the other; it is about
seven miles long, and tends straight from Looe to Leryn
Creek, in the direct line from Looe to Lostwithiel. By
all these properties, its height and breadth, in wanting the
fosses of fortification, its straightness and length, the grandeur
of the design, and the labour of execution, I judge
that it can be nothing less than a Roman work. In this
supposition I am the more confirmed, first, because several
Roman coins have been found on the banks of Fowey river
(as see “Antiquities of Cornwall,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 282), and, as I have
been informed, also in the run of this notable work; secondly,
by its tendency to the first ford over the navigable
river of Fowey; for it must be observed that the Romans,
thoroughly sensible of the delays and hazards of crossing
friths and arms of the sea, and the danger of bridges getting
into the possession of the natives, were equally averse both
to bridges and passing large rivers; they had therefore in
constant view the nearest and most commodious fords of
rivers, and directed their roads accordingly. Now near
Leryn Creek, where the work ends, there is a ford, and no
where below is the river Fowey fordable; which plainly
accounts for their conveying this road so high up the country,
that it might at once convey their troops towards their
station at Lostwithiel, and afford them a safe passage over
the river Fowey into the western parts, through Grampont
and Truro.”</p>

<p>Borlase also, in his Natural History, says, “There are
the remains of a causey between Liskeard and Looe, near
Polgover, the seat of Mr. Mayow, which, as well as the
cross road from Dulo to Hessenford, vulgar tradition makes
to be Roman.” This causey I have never been able to
find out.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned mound is first visible directly
above Looe bridge; so that, if a line was drawn west, as
<!--035.png--><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
the bridge tends, it would come to it at the head of a field
called Bridgend meadow, where a small orchard is planted.
There is a very visible ditch all along West Looe Down to
the north of the rampart. On the barton of Hall, however,
the ditch is to the south of the rampart. This rampart
on the barton of Hall is at least fifteen feet high and
about twenty feet thick at the base. About four hundred
paces north of it, as Borlase says, there are two apparently
(though not perfectly, as I was informed by Captain Dawson,
who assisted in taking the Trigonometrical Survey,
under Colonel Mudge) circular encampments, situated in
a field called Berry Park. Berry Park contains about
eighteen acres, and may be termed a tongue of land. It
has a valley on each side, and also at the bottom. Across
the isthmus, if I may so term it, of this tongue of land, runs
the mound, protecting that part of the field which the valleys
do not extend to. The circles (or rings, as they are
now called by the tenant) consist of one entire circle of
about 122 paces diameter, surrounded with a rampart,
ditch, and breast-work; the height of which rampart, from
the bottom of the ditch, is, I imagine, upwards of fifteen
feet, and must originally have been much higher. This
circle has but one gateway into it, which is guarded by
mounds without ditches, running upwards of fifty feet
into the circle. The part of this circle where the gateway
is, is surrounded by about three fourths of another circle,
whose sweep, had it been continued, would have intersected
the inner circle; but the southern part of this outermost
circle, when it comes within twenty or thirty feet of the
inner, falls into the segment of another circle, which runs
parallel to the inner circle, leaving a platform of about
fifty feet breadth between the two ditches, and surrounding
about a third part of the inner circle. From the gateway
of the inner to the opposite point of the outward circle, is
about 144 paces, which may be about three fourths of the
diameter. The outer circle has a similar rampart, ditch,
and breast-work with the inner circle, and one gateway,
<!--036.png--><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
which is not quite opposite that of the former. These
circles command very fine prospects both of land and sea.
Rame Head and the entrance into Plymouth are visible
from Berry Park. You can see these circles from Bindown
Hill with the naked eye; and from the elevation of
that hill you look down on them so as to see their areas.</p>

<p>In a field a short distance south-west of Pelynt church-town,
and about half a mile in a direct line from the said
circles, are many barrows. The field in which they are, is
I believe, called the The Five Barrows. At the bottom of
this field is a highway, leading from Pelynt Church-town
to the Fowey road. In this highway, just at the bottom of
the said field, a few years since, a grave was discovered by
some men mending the highway. It was formed by four
stones on their edges, and a covering stone. In this kestvaen
was an urn, with burnt ashes in it; and round the
urn were piled, in a regular manner, the unburnt remains
of human bones. I went to Pelynt purposely to see this
curiosity, but found the grave had been filled up, and its
contents buried. The urn was described to me by a man
who saw it as having ornaments of flowers and leaves on its
outside, and that it fell into sheards when touched. I could
not learn that any coin or other thing was found in the urn
or grave; indeed, I fancy there was a lack of curiosity in
all concerned.</p>

<p>Part of the mound on West Looe Down has been from
time to time dug down, to obtain earth for building and
plastering. I have several times desired the labourers, in
case of their finding any coin or other thing curious, to
preserve it; but have never heard of any thing being found
of late years. A celt (commonly called in this neighbourhood
a thunderbolt<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>) was some years ago found on this
Down; and it was given by the late Mr. Bawden, of Looe,
<!--037.png--><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
to Mr. James, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kevern. I have a celt, made of a
hard black stone, which was found in pulling down an old
house at East Looe a few years since; it is between six and
seven inches long, and very perfect. I lately saw some
like it in shape and stone, but not so large, in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>I also remember seeing a celt that was found, about thirty
years ago, at Kilminarth, near the ruin of the said mound:
about which time a gold chain and several instruments of
brass were found in a decayed hedge, or side of a highway,
near Little Larnic, by an apprentice girl. Her mistress
described them to me as being somewhat like hatchets, and
said “she believed they were things which the warriors
used in antient times.” I applied to the mistress, in hopes
of getting a sight of them; but her apprentice had sold
them to a buyer of old brass. The hedge formed one side
of the high road, not far from the said mound. The
apprentice told me that the gold chain was about a foot and
a half in length &mdash;that when she found it, not thinking it
was gold, she tied it to the end of a stick, and made a sort
of whip of it to drive home the cows. She some time after
discovered that it was gold, and kept it by her for several
years, when she gave it to her brother, who sold it to a
Mr. Patrick, a jeweller at Dock, for three pounds. The
brother told me that Mr. Patrick said it was Corsican gold;
and he (the brother) also told me that he well remembered
the brass instruments, and that some of them were like the
tops of spontoons.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">POLVELLAN.</p>

<p>On West Looe Down the late John Lemon, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> (M.P.
for Truro, and who died April 5, 1814), about the year
1787 erected a small but extremely neat house in the cottage
style, and inclosed some ground round it by virtue of
a grant from the Corporation. He gave it the name of
Polvellan, and laid it out with great taste. Pol, in Cornish,
<!--038.png--><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
signifies a Pool, and Vellan a Mill; and below the house
are a mill and pool, inclosed by a stone wall of about half
a mile sweep, in a circular direction. I cannot describe
the contrivance and use of this pool better than in the
words of Mr. Carew, in his “Survey of Cornwall.”&mdash;“Amongst
other commodities afforded by the sea, the
inhabitants make use of divers his creekes for grist mills, by
thwarting a banke from side to side, in which a flood-gate
is placed, with two leaves; these the flowing tide openeth,
and, after full sea, the weight of the ebb closeth fast, which
no other force can doe; and so the imprisoned water payeth
the ransome of driving an under shoote wheel for his
enlargement.” I apprehend the mill and pool-wall were
built by one of the Arundells of Tremodart, in Duloe
parish. The wall is about six or eight feet high, and
almost broad enough for a coach to pass over it, and must
have cost a great deal of money. It appears by a deed
which I have seen, that the Mayor and Burgesses of West
Looe, on the 30th of May, in the twelfth year of the reign
of James the First (1614), granted all that parcel, quantity
of ground, oze, or water, now surrounded by the said mill-pool-wall,
to Thomas Arundell, of Tremodart, in the parish
of Duloe, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> for 500 years, from thence next ensuing;
that afterwards the said Thomas Arundell built a mill-house,
and four grist-mills, and other houses, and also the
mill-pool-wall. On November 3, 1648, the said Thomas
Arundell made his will; and I believe the mills and mill-pool-wall
were built by him before he made his will. Afterwards
this term in these premises were assigned over by
the Arundells (father and son) and one Drew (perhaps a
mortgagee) to Sir Jonathan Trelawny, for the remainder
of the said term. I am apprehensive, however, that there
was a mill at this place previous to the aforesaid grant.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">INCLOSURE OF THE DOWN DESIRABLE.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that West Looe Down is not
wholly inclosed; the soil is very good, as is apparent from
<!--039.png--><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
the fine state of the grounds of Polvellan. The Looes
being bounded by the sea on one side, and by rivers and
woods on the other, arable land is much wanted. The objection
raised against this inclosure is, that the poor of West
Looe would be deprived of gathering furze and fern for
firing. But does not the labour wasted and cloaths worn
out in gathering this fuel more than counteract the gain?
If an inclosure were to be made, in a year or two the
hedges would produce greater quantity and more substantial
fuel than can now be obtained. The Down belongs to
the Corporation; but various tenants of houses and fields
claim a right of putting what is called Breaths (cattle),
some more, some less, to depasture on it. To such as are
entitled to put breaths on this, common allotments should
be made in proportion to the number of breaths they are
entitled to; and an allotment to the poor might be made
in lieu of their claim (if it is a legal one) to take furze and
ferns for firing. The many advantages which would arise
to the poor in particular from an inclosure, should be considered.
Exclusive of the numerous productions which
would follow, labour would be demanded, hedges must be
made, manure procured, land ploughed, corn tilled, cut,
<abbr title="et cetera, et cetera, et cetera">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</abbr> Milk, potatoes, <abbr title="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c. &amp;c.</abbr> would be obtained at
a much more moderate price than at present; and, no
doubt, the poor rate would soon find the beneficial effect of
an inclosure. In short, the advantages arising herefrom
would be very great; and I sincerely hope the prejudices
of the interested will soon be done away, and that the commoners
will get an Inclosure Act passed. Formerly the
Corporation used to let out certain parts of this Down for
tillage. There are several memorandums of such lets in
the Town Books. In 1621 that part of West Looe Down
which lieth on the west part of the Homer Well, was let to
rent, for two crops, at 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> per acre.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">
<!--040.png--><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
TRADE.</p>

<p>Formerly a pretty considerable trade was carried on at
Looe, and many ships belonging to this port used to go
from thence to France, Spain, and up the Straits, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Even so late as the beginning of the last century there
were several ships kept here, principally employed in
foreign voyages; but, for seventy or eighty years last past,
few, if any, have been so employed.</p>

<p class="p2">Tallan Church is most romantic in its situation; it contains
a curious monument to one of the Bevilles. Polbenro,
divided between this parish and Lansallos, affords
picturesque scenery superior to any on the southern coast
of Cornwall; and the whole road from Fowey to Looe, by
Polruan, Lansallas, Polperro, and Talland, will amply
compensate the fatigue of climbing hills, and descending into
deep vales, by the singular and striking prospects varied at
every point.</p>

<p>The manor of Killigarth belonged at an early period to
the family of Kilgat, evidently implying some relation between
the names.</p>

<p>Kilmenawth, or Kilmenorth, formed a part of the large
possessions belonging to Lord Chief Justice Trevilian, who
was murdered under some forms of law in the year 1388,
the 11th year of Richard the Second. This place was the
residence of Admiral Sir Charles Wager.</p>

<p>The hamlet of Lemain or Lammana, which seems to
have included a considerable portion of the parish with the
island, must have been of importance, since a record exists,
which states a division of the monastic property of Glastonbury,
between the bishop and his chapter on one part,
and the monks on the other, when about the year 1200,
Pope Innocent the Third removed the see of Wells to
that place.</p>

<p>The words are, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De Prioratibus quoque ad Glastoniensem
Ecclesiam pertinentibus, ita ordinatum est. Ut</span>
<!--041.png--><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prioratus de Hibernia ad ordinationem Episcopi, Prioratus
vero de Basselake, et de Lamana ad ordinationem conventus
pertineant.”</span></p>

<p>Portlooe appears to have been the principal estate of the
hamlet, but no traditions are extant about its antiquity.
It belonged about the middle of the last century to Mr.
John Hoskins of East Looe, probably by purchase; he left
an only daughter, who married first Mr. Edward Buller,
a brother of the Judge, This gentleman had been educated
in Holland according to the customs of those times, with a
view to trade, which however he never pursued, but settled
on his wife’s barton of Portlooe, and died there, leaving
several children. Mrs. Buller, nevertheless, married
secondly Mr. Thomas Escott, an officer in the Cornwall
Militia.</p>

<p>The island has probably passed through different hands
since the dissolution of Glastonbury Abbey. It recently
belonged to the family of Mayow, by whom it was sold for
a very trifling consideration, to Sir William Trelawny,
afterwards Governor of Jamaica.</p>

<p>Pel-Vellan, (the Mill Pool,) created and named by the
late Colonel John Leman, is an exquisite specimen of that
gentleman’s taste. The editor remembers it a wild
uncultivated uninclosed common, adjacent to the tide Mill.
About twenty years after the commencement of decorations,
he placed the following inscription where a rill
of water formed a small cascade under the shelter of some
shrubs, and of three or four trees which had stood on the
Down.</p>

Charles Wager, pages 165 to 173.</p>

<p><!--042.png--><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
The Admiral represented West Looe in Parliament, and
resided in the parish, but Mr. Bond has not been able to
collect any traces of his birth, either from tradition or from
records. There is a monument to his memory in Westminster
Abbey, with a long and appropriate inscription.</p>

<p>The barton and manor of Kyllygarth, including a
division of Polperro, are within this parish. The great
tithes and the advowson belong to the family of Kendall.</p>

THE MANOR OF TAMARTON.</p>

<p>This, in the extent of Cornish acres, 12 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives the descents of property in this
parish. He says the manor of North Tamarton was given
by Roger de Valletort to Richard Earl of Cornwall, and
that Roger Earl of Cornwall gave it to Gervase de Harningate.
It was afterwards in the Carminows. In 1620
it belonged to Tristram Arscott, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> and afterwards to
the Rolles, of whom it was purchased by the late Sir John
Call of Whiteford.</p>

<p>The manor of Hornacot or Horningcote belonged at an
early period to a family of that name; in 1620 it was possessed
by Sir Charles Howard, in right of his wife, the
daughter of Sir John Fitz of Fitzford near Tavistock, and
was afterwards in the Courtenays; and finally passed from
them by purchase to the late Mr. George Browne of
Bodmin.</p>

<p>Ogbere, called by Norden Ugbere, was in his time the
seat of William Lovice, and had been the residence of
Leonard Lovice, probably the father or grandfather of
William, and is stated, by a monumental inscription still
extant in the church, to have been Receiver-general of the
Duchy Revenues for Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Vacye, in remote times the seat of a family bearing the
same name, is now the residence of George Call, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
younger son of the late Sir John Call.</p>

<p>This parish contains besides the church town three small
villages called Alvacot, Headon, and Venton.</p>

<p>Tamarton measures 4788 statute acres.</p>

or a part of Drillavale or Dinnavale quarry, producing
the finest and most durable roofing slate of all that district;
and said by Bishop Watson, in his Chemistry, to be
the very best in England.</p>

<p>Treveares was for a long time the residence of a family
which began to rise about a century ago into considerable
opulence. Mr. Phillipps, of this place, settled as an attorney
in Camelford; and availing himself of the valuable
privileges possessed by that place, acquired a fortune. He
had three sons. The eldest son, Charles Phillipps, married
one of the coheiresses of the Longs of Penhele, and, not
having any family, transmitted her ample fortune to his
brother; he represented Camelford in Parliament, and was
Lieutenant-Colonel of the Cornwall Militia. The second
son, Jonathan Phillipps, originally a surgeon in the navy,
married the coheiress of the Amys of Botreaux Castle,
and through them of the Cottons, and also of the Gilberts
of Tacbear; this gentleman had several children, but survived
them all. He was knighted on the celebrated occasion
of Margaret Nicholson.</p>

<p>The third brother, William Phillipps, a clergyman,
never married.</p>

<p>They had one sister, who married Mr. Carpenter, of
Tavistock; and her descendants are possessed of nearly
the whole of the Phillipps property.</p>

<p>This farm, however, was demised by Mr. William Phillipps
to his relation Mr. William Dinham.</p>

<p>It would be improper not to mention, that Captain William
Bligh was a native of this parish, who commanded the
Bounty in the unfortunate expedition to procure plants of
the Bread-fruit tree (Artocarpus) from the South Sea
Islands in the years 1789 and 1790; but which object he
effected in a second voyage, and afterwards received the
appointment of Governor of New Holland.</p>

or habitation appropriated to the Canons, who from receiving
<!--050.png--><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
certain shares of the tithe for their maintenance,
were sometimes called Portionists. The Church is conjectured
to have been built in the reign of Henry the Seventh,
from the circumstances of his arms appearing there in a
manner to denote them coeval with the fabric.</p>

<p>There are several monuments, and among them one to
Mr. William Phillipps, probably father of the gentleman
who removed to Camelford as an attorney, and grandfather
to the three brothers mentioned above. He is stated to
have been of Treveans, and to have died on the 12th of
April 1712, in the <abbr title="sixty-second">62d</abbr> year of his age. The turnpike
road leading from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb by Wade Bridge and
Camelford to Launceston, nearly surrounds this Church. It
was for some years the great line of communication to the
west of Cornwall, till in 1767 a commencement was made
on a more direct line over Tregoss Moors on one side of
Bodmin, and Temple Moors on the other. This road so
entirely superseded the former as to cause an entire loss of
capital to those who contributed towards making it; and
the road itself fell back into a state of repair inferior to that
of most parish roads. It has, however, recently been taken
up as a new concern, and in 1835 a stage coach has been
established on it.</p>

<p>The Editor has heard from the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Phillipps,
who died in 1794, that the making of this road was taken
up as a matter of patriotism; and that to assist the undertaking,
he cut with his own hands the figures on the granite
mile stones, which still remain.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>This parish is situated on rocks belonging to the calcareous
series. On the eastern boundary, however, near the
church, the slate is nearly connected with the porphyritic
series; here at Treburget is a lead mine in a blue pyrituous
slate; the lodes run north-east and south-west, varying
from two feet to five feet in thickness. The matrix of the
ores consists of angular pieces of slate like fragments
cemented by quartz, in which galena, blend, iron pyrites,
and spathous iron occur.</p>

<p>Proceeding northward, this lamillar blue slate is succeeded
by a shining talcose slate; and at Rediver Mills on
the road to Port Isaac, a hard compact rock is quarried
for the roads, which contains veins of magnesian minerals;
this rock occurs on the side of a steep round-backed hill;
and those circumstances, combined with the talcose slate,
render it probable that magnesian rocks may exist in the
neighbourhood. These rocks are succeeded by slate traversed
by veins of antimony, similar to what occurs in
Endellion.</p>

As for the name, it is derived from the Latin Templum,
and signifies amongst Christians, a church, chapel, or
temple for performing Divine Service or worship to God,
by contemplation or action of body or mind.</p>

<p>But here, in a more especial manner so called for, that
this church or chapel was a cell or temple pertaining to the
great master of the Knights Templars of Jerusalem, under
its superior in the Middle Temple of London, now the
lawyers’ Inn, where was their chief manor or commandery.
This religious fraternity took an oath of confederacy,
for aiding and assisting all persons, pilgrims, and
strangers, that intended by way of Joppa to visit Jerusalem
and the sepulchre of our Saviour; who, for that by licence
of the abbot of a church there called the Temple, in which
they had their seats (as is now used in our churches), they
were from thence called Templars.</p>

<p>This district now in Cornwall, consisting only of eight
tenements of land, and about thirty human souls, in the
Domesday Book 1087, was taxed under the jurisdiction of
Nietstone, still contiguous therewith. In the inquisition of

grass widows with their fatlings put to lie in and nurse
here. [This practice still continues, and has given rise to
a mode of expression, which sends off unmarried but pregnant
women to lie in privately, by despatching them to the
Moors, meaning that long range of wilderness which is
called Temple Moors. W.]</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>This church was certainly founded by the Knights Templars,
in compliance with a custom very prevalent among
the military monastic orders, of establishing Preceptories in
desert and uncultivated places, with the view of introducing
inhabitants, or of civilizing the few that might be scattered
over a wilderness. The benevolent intentions of these
gallant knights failed however in this particular instance:
the parish, which, judging from the analogy of similar
cases, must have been large, perhaps co-extensive with the
Moors to which it imparted a name, has shrunk into one of
the least in Cornwall. Its church has disappeared. The
churchyard is not distinguishable from any other inclosure;
and the few parishioners resort to neighbouring churches

<p>This little parish is something in the form of an obtuse

<p>Mr. Lysons treats of Launceston, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Thomas together. There is very little remarkable about
this parish. The church, which is very small, and provided
with a tower scarcely more lofty than the roof, stands close
by the water; but it occupies the spot where the stately
Priory described under Launceston heretofore extended its
hospitality to travellers, and bestowed well intended,
although mistaken charity, to all the neighbourhood. Nothing
more remains of the Priory than the foundation of
walls and an arched well of excellent water. The church
has some monuments.</p>

<p>I take the name of the parish to signify no other than
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wednock or Wynnock; for Ta and Da are synonymous
terms for good. [It is perhaps only Ti Widnak (C.) the
Whitish House. W.] It is a daughter church or chapel of

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>There can scarcely be a doubt of this parish, Landewednack,
and some chapels, being dedicated to one of the Missionaries
from Ireland.</p>

<p>Towednack, like most of the districts situated on granite,
exhibits a strange and almost unaccountable mixture of
cultivated and of unreclaimed soils. On one side of a fence
may be seen land producing abundance of grass and excellent
for daisies, or bearing ample crops of barley, and of
clover hay and on the other side, an inclosed waste, named
throughout Cornwall a croft, producing nothing better than
<!--058.png--><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
the species or variety of furze, Ulex Nanus, and some of
the most coarse grasses.</p>

<p>This parish has been productive of much tin near the
surface; but a wide stripe of granite nearly resembling that
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s in Brannel, extends from the parish of
Zennor through Towednack, and thence into Ludgvan,
including Castle-an-Dinas, which Mr. Hals by mistake
places in this parish. Its course is distinctly marked by
the absence of all bolder rocks from the surface, and in
some places it has been wrought for china clay, found quite
equal in quality to that near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, but occurring in
layers of but little breadth, and therefore expensive to pursue.
This soft granite, called by the miners whetstone,
permits the lodes to continue their courses through it from
the hard and crystallized granite, but the tin in a great
measure disappears at a trifling depth.</p>

<p>There is little connected with Towednack of any curiosity,
that does not refer to the Editor and his family.</p>

<p>I am possessed of a manor still extending into five
parishes, of which the vokeland, to use Mr. Hals’s term,
was Amellibrea in this parish. It has descended to me
from the Noyes, and particularly from my direct ancestor
William Noye, the Attorney-General. I have the Court
Rolls in complete succession for nearly three centuries.
On these Rolls the names of Godolphin, Grylls, Mahun,
Praed, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, Veal, occur with others as free tenants,
and a great number of persons held by copy of Court Roll.</p>

<p>At Amellibrea are the remains of an extensive foundation
said by tradition to have formerly supported a prison.</p>

<p>But the free tenants have been lost, and the copyholds
converted into leases for life, as indeed has been the case
generally over Cornwall, with the exception of ecclesiastical
property; the copyholds not being renewable on the payment
of a fine not exceeding two years’ value, as is the
custom over most parts of England, but dependent wholly
on the pleasure of the lord. The tenures were therefore
in themselves much the same; and as I remember to have
heard, the tenants preferred chattle property, as they termed
<!--059.png--><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>
it, to copyhold, in consequence probably of the uniform
rules of succession and the facility of disposing by will.</p>

<p>The last copyhold that appears on the Rolls was in the
very beginning of the last century.</p>

<p>The particulars of holding a Court in those days, with
the Steward’s charge, happen to be preserved on the Roll
for 1688, and seem to me sufficiently curious to warrant
their insertion.</p>

thing rashly, or unadvisedly; but certainly to know the

all that make default you must present.</p>

manors, and what is due to the Lord on his death;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> and
also if any copyholder has leased his copyhold for any
longer term than a year and a day, without the Lord’s
license, it is a forfeiture of his copyhold. And also if any
copyholder deny to pay his rent, or deny to come to his
Lord’s Court, or deny to be sworn of the homage, it is a
forfeiture of his copyhold.</p>

<p class="blockquote">And also you are to present all alienations that you may
know among the tenants, who they are, and for what.</p>

<p class="blockquote">You are also to present all such as remove any bounds
bounding the lands of these manors and the lands of any
other Lord, or between tenant and tenant, or elsewhere in
those manors.</p>

<p class="blockquote">You are likewise to present any one that has taken any
<!--061.png--><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
goods out of the pound wilfully by force, or any pound-breaker
by the way, as they are driven to pound.</p>

<p class="blockquote">You are likewise to present any man that hath fished or
fowled in these manors, or hawked or hunted.</p>

<p class="blockquote">And also you are to present any that doth refuse or neglect
to grind at the mill of those manors; and if you are
not well served, you that are ill dealt with by the miller, he
is lyable to be prosecuted, and make satisfaction.</p>

<p class="blockquote">You are to present all tin broken in these manors that
hath not paid farme nor toll.</p>

will be true and faithful to the Lord of those manors, and

and services as you ought to pay, and for all such lands and

to the Dinhams and Cardinhams, by descent from Richard,
Steward of the household to William the Conqueror at the
time of the Domesday Survey, is now vested in fee in William
Braddon, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Treglith in this parish, who is lessee

and to the representatives of the Gilberts of Tacbear
through Cotton and Amy. Mr. Braddon inherited this

had purchased it from the family of Symons, who resided
at Treglith.</p>

<p>The church of Treneglos was given by the above-named
Richard, so early as the time of the Conqueror, to the

<p>Mr. Lysons says, that this parish is an appendage to the
manor of Werrington. This would indicate its being impropriated
by the Abbey of Tavistock, as Werrington was
the chief seat of the Lord Abbat; but Tresmere is not
noticed in the Valor Ecclesiasticus of that Abbey; but in
the Valor Ecelesiasticus of Launceston Priory there occurs
this trifling entry:</p>

<p>The tithes of this parish are completely in lay hands.
When tithes were first bestowed on monasteries, the
duties of the Church to which they appertained, were performed
by members of the Convent, who occasionally travelled
there, and succeeded each other; the “book-bosomed
priests” of the Last Minstrel. In times more remote,
secular clergy went on circuits from the Cathedral or seat
of the Bishop and his priests; till the inconvenience of this
itinerant system became strongly felt, and decrees were
made in several General Councils of the Latin Church,
<!--069.png--><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>
enacting that each benefice should have a permanently
resident priest, and that a competent provision should be
made for his support. This was usually done by assigning
to the deputy, the Vicarius or Vicar, all the tithes except
those of corn, although others were occasionally retained;
but in various instances, instead of tithes, an allowance was
made in money, equivalent perhaps at the time, but long
since reduced to nominal payments, by the gradual depreciation
in the value of gold and silver from natural causes,
and by the fraudulent reduction of the standards practised
in various degrees by all governments, or lastly, by the non-convertible
paper currencies.</p>

<p>The very great difference in the circumstances of those
deputies, arising from the nature of their endowments rather
than any legal distinction in the offices, has affixed to one the
name of Vicar, and to the other that of Perpetual Curate.</p>

<p>It appeared from Mr. Tonkin’s narrative, that the stipend
in this parish amounted to six pounds a year, and
that it had been withholden by superior force; without
doubt, the liberality of modern times has long since caused
it to be restored and increased.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons states, that the impropriation has passed
through the families of Molesworth and Manaton, and that
it is now vested in Edward Coade, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and that this great
piece of preferment is in the Crown.</p>

GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>This parish is situated on rocks of the calcareous series,
which are for the most part like those of Laneast; but
where Trewen joins Alternun, bounded only by the small
river Inney, some strata occur which deserve more particular
notice. It has already been stated, that on the opposite
side of this stream, a potstone or ollareous serpentine
occurs; on the Trewen side a talcose schist first appears,
which is followed by a calcareous schist, with its surface
talcose and glossy, resembling the slate at Cotele on the
Tamar. This slate gradually passes into a compact limestone,
which is light-coloured and talcose, especially in
such parts as come in contact with masses of hornstone
diffused through the mass. This limestone is quarried
and burnt on the spot, but after the selection of such portions
as abound with calcareous spar.</p>

<p>Truro is situate in the hundred of Powder, and hath
upon the north Kenwen, east Clement’s, south an arm of
Falmouth Harbour, where twice a day, upon spring tides,
the sea makes its navigable flux and reflux to the walls,
keys, and streets thereof.</p>

<p>In the Domesday Book 1087, this place was taxed under
the appellations of Trewret and Treured, which shews that
it then consisted of two privileged manors or jurisdictions,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the borough of Trewret and the manor of Treured,
<!--075.png--><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
now known, and still distinguished, by the names of the
borough and manor of Truro, under the like circumstances.</p>

<p>In the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester
1294, into the value of Cornish Benefices, Ecclesia
de Trewroe, in decanatu de Powdre, was rated <abbr title="fifty-three">liii</abbr><span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
<abbr title="four">iv</abbr><span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p>By the Charter of its incorporation from King John, the
town was incorporated by the name of Burgus de Trewrow.</p>

<p>In Wolsey’s Inquisition 1521, this church’s revenues
were valued at £16. The patronage formerly in Bodrigan
or Trenowith, now Edgecumb. The incumbent Pagett;
and the borough of Truro was rated to four shillings per
pound Land Tax for one year, 1696, £186. 7<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> That
here was a Christian free chapel before the Norman Conquest
I doubt not, implied in the word Trewrow, now a
Rectory Church; in the glass windows of which, the north
side thereof, is yet extant the arms of John Earl of Cornwall,
who succeeded to the Crown of England 1199, and
was made Earl of Cornwall by his father King Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
at nine years old (though he had not the possession
thereof till the time of Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1190, which was but a
hundred and twenty-four years after the Norman Conquest,
and but one hundred and three years after the Conqueror’s
death); which arms were: in a field Ruby, three
leopards in pale passant gardant Tophaz, over all a bend
Sapphire, which leopards are now called, and metamorphosed
in the blazon of the Kings of England’s arms to
lions, as it is testified by Nicholas Upton, who wrote his
Book of Heraldry 1440, whose words be these: <span lang="frm" xml:lang="frm">“Monsieur
Johanes Roy d’Angleter, port de Gowles, ove trois lyopers
d’Or.”</span></p>

<p>There is likewise extant in the same windows, the Prince
of Wales and Duke of Cornwall’s badge, in a field &mdash;&mdash;
three ostrich feathers with this motto or inscription, Ich
Dien, or Ich Thyen, Saxon, I serve, which coronet was
won by Edward the Black Prince, the first Duke of Cornwall,
<!--076.png--><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
from John of Luxemberge, King of Bohemia, at the
battle of Cressy, 1346, and ever since worn by him and his
successors, Dukes of Cornwall and Princes of Wales; which
arms we may conclude was erected in this glass window
soon after that victory, he being High Lord of this borough,
which is held of his contiguous Duchy Manor of Moris,
together with the Coinage Hall, which King John built
and gave it; as also the royalty over the whole Harbour of
Falmouth as far as Carike Road and the Black Rock
Island (see Falmouth) in consideration of twelve pence
rent and suits to that Manor Court, which privileges and
royalty this town enjoyed till the time of King James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
and executed their water processes all over the said harbour
for debt and damage; but then, upon the petition of
Sir Peter Killigrew, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> it was given by him as an augmentation
of profit to Mr. Quaram, Rector of Falmouth,
and his successors for ever, but under what rent I know not.</p>

<p>The church was built at the proper cost and charge of
the inhabitants, and other pious benefactors, with free-stone,
in that costly and curious manner as it now stands, in the
reigns of Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> and Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> as appears from an
inscription in the glass windows thereof, under the name
and arms of Margaret Tregian, one of those benefactors
1514; wherein also are yet extant the arms of the Arundells,
Bevills, Trenowths, Carmenows, Edgecombs, and
other benefactors; however, this church hath no tower or
steple of bells as other churches.</p>

<p>And moreover, as when it was a free chapel, the minister
subsisted on the oblations and obventions of the altar, so
now, comparatively, upon the piety and charity of his
hearers by voluntary subscriptions; from whence it may
be presumed the rector must demean himself well, and
labour hard in his vocation, to get a competent maintenance,
at least he must walk with such upright and wary
conduct as he that went barefoot upon the edge of a sharp
knife and did not hurt his feet; since he must converse with,
and have to do with, men of divers principles and opinions
<!--077.png--><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
in religion in this place, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Anabaptists, Presbyterians,
and Quakers, as of old his predecessors had with monks,
Dominican and Franciscan friars, who were sharers or
peelers of his profits by their predicaments. I shall not
enter into the controversy whether the Gospel were better
preached before churches were endowed with revenues, or
since, the one being a motive to pride, sloth, and laziness;
as the other is an inducement to humility, temperance, and
virtue.</p>

<p>In this church stands a curious monument erected to the
memory of John Robartes, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> that married Gaurigan (ancestor
of the Right Honourable Charles Bodville, Earl of Radnor)
though much defaced in the interregnum of Cromwell;
whose ancestor John Robarts, Mayor of Truro, that
lies entombed thereby, mightily enriched himself in this
town by trade and manufactures.</p>

<p>There is also near the same another funeral monument,
erected to the memory of three brothers of the Mitchells,
tempore James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Thomas, John, and James, as I remember,
who, as the inscription saith, had all one God,
one womb, and one tomb.</p>

<p>On the west side of this town was of old a Dominican
Chapel and Friary; part of their house and consecrated
well yet standing; their revenues dispersed into several
hands since the dissolution of their house 26 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
and now in possession of &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>In the centre of this town was a nunnery of Clares
closed up, who had considerable revenues, now in possession
of Sir John Seyntaubyn and others; their consecrated
walled well at Edles in Kenwen, and their house called
Anhell, i. e. the hall or tabernacle, was fairly built of free-stone,
though lately pulled down, and converted to shops
and dwelling houses.</p>

<p>The town of Truro was made a coinage town by King
John as aforesaid, and had all its privileges confirmed by a
charter from Queen Elizabeth, by the name of the Mayor
and Capital Burgesses; and consists of a Mayor, Recorder,
<!--078.png--><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
and twenty-four Capital Burgesses. The members of Parliament
are elected by the majority of inhabitants of the
said Corporation; the arms of which are, a ship man-of-war
in full course, with sails spread, on the seas, wherein
are fishes swimming.</p>

<p>The precept on the Parliament writ from the Sheriff,

<p>This place is more notable as being the birthplace and
honorary title of John Lord Robarts, Baron Robarts of
Truro (see Lanhydeiock). It is also privileged with fairs
annually, on the 19th of November, the 8th of December,
Wednesday after Midlent Sunday, and on Whitsun Monday

Saturdays; wherein all commodities necessary for the life of
man are vended in great plenty at a moderate rate, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
fresh fish, oysters, lobsters, and crabs of all sorts, corn,
fruits.</p>

<p>The salary of the collector of the Custom House here is
yearly £40, two tidemen and a waiter £80 per annum.</p>

<p>Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall 1602, tells us this
town of Truro, for wealth and riches, exceeded any other
town in Cornwall, and for buildings all other except Lanceston;
I think it still under the same circumstances.</p>

<p>In this town at some time lived Captain William Upcott

valour and conduct in the war, who in all the unhappy
Civil Wars between King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and his Parliament,
was bred up in the school of Mars from his youth, first an
Ensign, then a Lieutenant, lastly made a Commander of a
foot company under the Earl of Essex and Sir Thomas
Fairfax’s armies for the Parliament; afterwards he was
made Coronet of General Monk’s Horse Troop or Brigade,
who specially favoured him, and in that capacity
accompanied him throughout all the fatigues of the English,
Scots, and Irish wars, managed by him and Cromwell
against Kings Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; and when Monk came
out of Scotland and returned into England with his army,
and restored King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> to his throne.</p>

<p>Truro is situate in the hundred of Powder, and is surrounded

the east by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s, being washed on each side by two
rivulets (of which that which comes from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen is the
principal), and which joining together at the bottom of the

the town, as that does from the three principal streets of
which it consists, Tri, three, and Ru, a street, turned to
Truro, euphoniæ gratiâ. [See below concerning this
Etymon, which is adopted from Camden, and is obviously
absurd, as the town must have had a name long before it
forked out into three streets; and indeed from the first
moments of its existence as a town, as a parish, or as a

<p>Leland (<abbr title="Itinerary">Itin.</abbr> <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 11) speaketh thus of this
town: “This Creke of Truru afore the very toun is divided
into two partes, and eche of them hath a brook cumming
down, and a bridge, and the toun of Truru bytwixt
them booth. The White Freres house was on the west
arme yn Kenwyn Streate.</p>

<p>“Kenwen Streate is severed from Truru with this arme,
and Clementes Streat by est is separate on the est from
Truru with the same arme.</p>

<p>“One paroche chirch in Truru; Kenwen, and Clementes

<p>“Coynage of tinne at Midsomer and Michaelmas at

<p>“Truru is a borow toun, and priviledged. There is a
Castelle, a quarter of a mile by west out of Truru, longing
to the Erle of Cornwale, now clene doun. The site
therof is now used for a shoting and playing place. Out
of the body of Truru creake, on the est side, breketh a
crek estwarde a mile from Truru, and goith up a mile &mdash;&mdash;,
perhaps to Kigan, and thens to Tresilian Bridge.”</p>

<p>Nothing can be better described than the situation of
this town is here by Leland; only as to the castle, it is so
far from being a quarter of mile out of the town that it is
in it at the head of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pancras-street, to the left hand of
the way as you go to Kenwyn church, which by the bye is
no Saint as Leland has here made it, or ever called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Kenwyn. [The difference between Mr. Tonkin and his
author concerning the castle, is no difference at all. Mr.
Tonkin forgets the interval of time between Leland’s writing
and his own. At that time the castle was assuredly out
of the town; <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pancras-street then going up but a little
way from the open area by the church-yard, and the castle
<!--081.png--><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
being now “at the head” of this street.] It lies very
pleasantly, and from it you have a view of the whole town,
the country around it, and the river, or rather arm of the sea,
which, when the tide is in, looks like a fine canal of two
miles in length, [and in coming up the canal by boat, the
town with its new spire below, and the church of Kenwin
with its new vicarage-house above, form a most pleasing
view]; but the castle itself is more like an old Danish
camp or round, than a place that had been once inhabited,
there not being the least sign left of any wall, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>At the last visitation of this county (Heralds’ Office) it
is said that “the town and borough of Truro was incorporated
by the name of mayor and burgesses by Reignald
Earl of Cornwall, natural son to Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> which as appeareth
by record, was done by Richard Lucy alias Lacam,
testibus Rogero de Valitort, Roberto de Edune Anvilla,
Ricardo de Raddona, Aldredo de <abbr title="Saint">S<sup>to</sup>.</abbr> Martino, sealed with
an ancient seal with a man on horseback.</p>

<p>“And at the time of this present visitation, the 9th of
October 1620, was Gregory Frignis Major, Thomas Burgess,
Richard Daniell, James Lawarren, William Catcher,

<p class="p2 center small">
<!--082.png--><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
WHITAKER.</p>

<p>Here I shall add some remarks that will illustrate the
origin of this town more than Mr. Tonkin has done.</p>

<p>Truro takes its name from its castle. This, in Leland’s
time, belonged to the Prince of Wales as Earl of Cornwall,
and was therefore one of the castellated palaces of the
Cornish Earls; it was only a small one, however. This
the ground of it shows when the walls are gone. Even
in Leland’s time, it was “clene doun;” and the area
was used as a place of exercise for shooting with bows and
arrows, and for other diversions. It “is now,” says Mr.
Tonkin, “more like an old Danish camp or round than a
place that had been once inhabited.” What ideas Mr. Tonkin
had of an “old Danish camp,” I cannot say; but the
castle carries no appearance of a camp at all, either Danish,
Saxon, or Roman. Nor is it more like a round, if by “a
round” Mr. Tonkin means a Cornish one, like the amphitheatrical
“round” of Piran. The only remains of the castle,
indeed, are the name, a waste area, and the old mount or
keep, the earth of which is nearly gone, and is daily vanishing
by application of it to other purposes. This artificial
mount marks the centre of the castle, had the main tower
upon it, and constituted the principal part of the whole;
and a small ward must have gone round it, standing on the
natural ground, and forming the offices to this petty palace.</p>

<p>This was plainly the origin of the town:&mdash;where an ancient
Earl’s house was, however small in its extent, and
however occasional in its use, it naturally drew the traders
of the country to it. The wants of such a Lord’s household,
and the accompanying treasury of a kingdom in a
county, created such a call for wares, and produced such a
currency of wealth, as made it for its season the little centre
of trade to the adjoining country; and a town grew up in
time, the weakly child of its castle at first, but able to subsist
without the castle at last. Such, undoubtedly, was the
<!--083.png--><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
origin of Truro. This lay upon the more westerly of the
two currents; the westerly side of the town, therefore,
would be the primitive and original part of it; accordingly,
we see the White Friars’ house constructed with it. From
this current it extended, as it enlarged, to the easterly one.
The erection of a church on that side, when a district was
taken out of Kenwin parish, and the peninsulated ground
between the currents was formed into a parish of itself,
drew it easterly with great power. The town consisted at
first, probably, of the street running from the foot of the
hill on a part of which the castle stood, and extending
backwards with its yards and gardens to the western current;
and this part of course adopted the previous appellation
of the castle, and was called with it Tre-vereu, Tre-ureu,
or Truru, Treuro, or Truro, the house or castle
upon the Uro or Uru, the same denomination of a river
with that of the Vere in Hertfordshire, the Vera-lamium of
the Itineraries, the Uro-lanium of Ptolemy, and with that
of the Eure in Yorkshire, the Uluracum, and the Is-urium
of the geography and itineraries.</p>

<p>So originating from the castle, in that primary part of
the whole, the western side of the town, and in that most
primary point of all, the line of houses above, the town
would naturally shoot out next in the line of houses opposite
to this on each side of the opening towards the church,
and beside the church on each side, drawn on by the strong
attraction of the church itself. The roads into the town
from east and west would then allure it down to their
respective passes over the current; the road from the west
then coming down, as it still does, at the bottom of the first
line of houses; and that from the east coming within these
thirty years by the narrow street near the church, at the
corner of which is the rectory-house. The town would
then extend from the western access into it, in a street of
houses running at right angles with the original street of the
whole, and pushing directly in a line from the access. These
must have been the three streets from which Camden supposed
<!--084.png--><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
the name to have been derived: “Truro, Cornwallice
Treuru, a tribus plateis dictum,” (page 138); but this
last street was afterwards split by the corporation into two,
by the erection of a town-hall above and a market-house
below, along the middle of it. In this state stood the town
probably for some time, with the continuance of this middle
row of buildings, with the erection of a coinage-hall
for tin a little beyond the termination of it, and with the
extension of the two original sides of this third street up
to it. It then stretched up the hill towards the castle,
ranged over the confining currents on the east and west,
into the parishes of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s and Kenwin, and expatiated
down to the quay and beside it. It ranged over the
western current, now probably covered with a bridge, before
it pushed up the hill towards the castle, as that line of
houses is called Kenwin-street, even by Leland, and this is
denominated <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pancras-street by Mr. Tonkin; that was
then the way, the circuitous way to Kenwin Church, when
this is the direct way, and the present; and the principal
alteration which has happened to Truro since, has resulted
from the erection of a new bridge over the eastern current,
longer and grander than the other, a few yards lower in the
channel than it, lining with the eastern road, and leading
directly to the Town-hall and market-house. This naturally
produced a Bridge-street, leading up at one end of
the Coinage-hall, so falling into what was then the principal
stem of the town, and thus communicating with all the
branches; and all will be consummated in a few years by
executing an Act of Parliament which has already passed,
in taking down that middle row of buildings which is
formed by the town-hall and its accompaniments, restoring
this street to its original width, and multiplying houses for
the dislodged inhabiters in the extreme parts of the town.</p>

<p>When the church was originally built I know not, but it
was then dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pancras, I apprehend, though it
is now to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, as the street leading down to one corner
of the large area at it, which is popularly denominated
<!--085.png--><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
Pider-street at present, is still denominated <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pancras-street
by Mr. Tonkin; but the present church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary
is of that light and elegant sort of Gothic architecture
which took place among us in the reign of Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>
and which perhaps might be wished to have still continued
among us, as being a happy union of the solemn solidity
of the Gothic and of the luminous lightness of the Roman.
At this period the church must have been built, the
architecture of London by degrees reaching out its influence
into Cornwall; and accordingly in the southern
window, which is the third from the east, is a date of 1518.</p>

<p>But let me be more particular concerning the antiquity
of Truro. The castle is not mentioned in Domesday
Book;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> it was therefore later than the Conquest. It was
built by some of the Norman Earls of Cornwall, and was
one of the rural palaces, as it were, which they had in
the county subordinate to their grand capitals at Launceston,
Tremarton, and Restormel. The town must be still
later than the castle; yet it is noticed within a century after
the Conquest, so nearly coeval was it with its cause, the
castle. It is noticed above to have been in the possession
of Richard de Lucy. It was incorporated, says the Visitation
above, “as appeareth by record, by Richard Lucy,
alias Lacam.” “Truro, Truru, or Trevereu,” adds that
best investigator of our constitutional antiquities, because
the most grounded on the evidence of records, Dr. Brady,
“was some time in the possession of Richard de Lucy, a
person of great note in the reigns of King Stephen and
Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> in the eighth of whose [Henry’s] reign,” or,
<abbr title="anno Domini">an. Dom.</abbr> 1162, “he was made Justice of England.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
This Richard had got possession of this part of the old
estates of the earldom, either by one of those half-alienations,
which were only sub-infeodations in reality, or (as we
shall soon see) by being Earl of Cornwall himself. He
actually resided in the castle, as he is styled in an instrument
<!--086.png--><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
of Henry the Second’s, “Ricardi de Lucy de Trivereu;”
and he encouraged the little town of the Earls, by
incorporating it, and so giving it a legal dignity in granting
it an internal jurisdiction. He even proceeded to allow it
that last and highest privilege of a borough, a freedom of
exemption from toll; nor was this confined to the borough
itself; it extended beyond it; it extended into all the country
round; it was commensurate with the whole county;
and Richard must, therefore, have acted with a power, not
merely of the lord of the borough, but of the earl of the
county, as no one less than an earl could have given such an
ample sweep of exemption. The proof of all this lies in
the original charter of the town, not now in existence, but
referred to in a succeeding charter, and particularised so as
to be equal to the very charter itself. The town thus began
about the year 1100, was incorporated about 1130 perhaps,
and was made a free borough (as we shall instantly
see) before 1140.</p>

<p>In the reign of King Stephen, who came to the throne
in 1135, and in the fifth year of it, or 1140, Lucy resigned
up the possessions of the earldom; as then, “Reginald
Fitzroy, who was one of the illegitimate sons of King
Henry the First, was created Earl of Cornwall.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> Reginald
was, therefore, invested with all that Lucy had possessed.
This he retained till his death, which happened
in the 21st of Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> or the year 1175. We accordingly
find him extending his more than half-royal graces
to his borough of Truro, by granting it a charter confirmatory
of the privileges which Lucy had conceded to it before.
“The town and borough of Truro,” says the Visitation,
“was incorporated by the name of the Mayor and
Burgesses, by Reignald Earl of Cornwall, natural son to
Henry the First (which, as appeareth by record, was done
by Richard Lucy, alias Lacam), testibus Rogero de Valitort,
Roberto de Edune Anvilla, Ricardo de Radiona, Aldredo
<!--087.png--><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martino, sealed with an ancient seal, with a
man on horseback.” This description shows the charter
to have been actually inspected by the visitors; yet Dr.
Brady knows it only from the recital of a subsequent charter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
The original is lost in the Tower, I suppose, while
its counterpart is preserved at Truro; and it runs thus in
the Inspeximus, 13 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 61. “Reginaldus Regis
Filius,” not as in descriptive terms the son of the King,
but merely as a personal and family appellative, Fitzroy,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Comes Cornubiæ; omnibus Baronibus Cornubiæ, et
omnibus militibus, et omnibus libere tenentibus, et omnibus
tam Anglicis quam Cornubiensibus, salutem. Sciatis, quod
concessi,”</span>&mdash;a word that shows even confirmatory charters to
do, what our legal antiquaries are naturally unaware that
they do, to use the language of granting just as if they
were original charters, and so leave us to decide from other
circumstances, which are original and which confirmatory &mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Liberis
Burgensibus meis de Trivereu,”</span> where the note
of previous freedom in the Burgesses proves them to have
been already freed from toll, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“habere omnes liberas consuetudines
et urbanas,”</span> the same exemption from toll that
all cities (which were in the King’s demesne) had, “et
easdem in omnibus quas habuerunt in tempore Ricardi de
Lucy,” a plain evidence that they had “free customs,”
and that they themselves, therefore, were “free Burgesses”
in the time of Richard de Lucy, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“scilicet Sacham et Socham,
et Tholl et Them, et Hinfangenethuf [Infangthief],”</span>
that is, all those rights of judicature over themselves,
and over others who came among them, that then
belonged to all the manorial courts, and that were necessarily
given to the Burgesses of Truro when they were
incorporated, and by incorporation were enabled to exercise
a jurisdiction independent of the common officers of
justice: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“et concessi eis, quod non placitent in Hundredis,</span>
<!--088.png--><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nec Comitatibus, nec pro aliquâ summonitione eant ad placitandum
alicubi extra villam Trivereu,”</span> a privilege consequent
upon the grant of an internal jurisdiction, and necessary
to its completion: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“et quod quieti sint de Tholneo
dando per totam Cornubiam, in feriis et in foris, et ubicunque
emerint et vendiderint,”</span> a privilege which must have
been a very valuable one to a society of traders, and the
more valuable from its long reach over all the fairs and
markets of the county: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“et quod, de pecuniâ eorum
accreditâ et non redditâ, namium capiant in villâ suâ de
debitoribus suis,”</span> by distraining the cattle, and arresting
the persons of their debtors, that came into the town,
though they did not belong to it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span> This charter is without
a date; with so many and such witnesses no date being
necessary; and as it must have been prior to the Earl’s
death, it was before the year 1175.</p>

<p>Henry the Second confirmed Reginald’s charter, as
Reginald confirmed Lucy’s; and all were re-confirmed by
Edward the First in 1284.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> But in all these charters, we
have no intimation of that grand privilege which we are
sure Truro to have possessed, and which is alluded to in
the Visitation above. “We find also,” says the Visitation,
“that the Mayor of Truro hath always been, and still is,
Mayor of Falmouth, as by an ancient grant, now in custody
of the said Mayor and Burgesses, doth appear.” The
superiority of Truro over all the harbour of Falmouth we
see is here attested by a record of 1622; and “an ancient
grant, now in the custody of the Mayor and Burgesses,”
is appealed to by the record. This distinguishing privilege
had been ceded to Truro by a grant of a particular
nature; but from the manner in which the Visitation refers
to it, the grant must have been so early as to be without
a date, and so be like Reginald’s and Lucy’s charters before;
and it was probably, therefore, about the same age
with them. [<span class="sc">Whitaker.</span>]</p>

THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Truro has long claimed to be the first town in Cornwall;
and the station has generally been allowed, although
several others exceed it in beauty of situation. Penzance
in that respect, as well as in foreign trade and the magnitude
of its internal commerce; and Falmouth in the
number of inhabitants.</p>

<p>Truro, situated adjacent to the largest mining district,
at the head of a navigable river, and nearly in the centre of
population, has acquired the lead in all county concerns, and
has the good fortune to possess many large handsome houses,
and breadth of streets unknown in the other towns. Here,
too, for a long series of years, was situated the chief place
of education for the heirs of Cornish families, at a time
when the state of communication between places two or
three hundred miles apart, rendered it a matter of serious
importance to think of sending a lad to either of the public
schools. Two very eminent masters of the school at
Truro are still remembered, Mr. Conor, a layman, from
the north of England, or Scotland, by the tradition of our
fathers; and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Cardew, by some among the best
classical scholars in both Universities. There is a monument
to Dr. Cardew in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erme Church. It is also understood,
that their predecessor, Mr. Jane, either established
or maintained the reputation of this school. Mr.
Jane is understood to have been a native of Leskeard, and
a nephew of Doctor William Jane, Regius Professor of
Divinity at Oxford and Dean of Gloucester, who drew up
the strong Declaration adopted by the University in favour
of the principles which would have retained King James on
the throne of England, and when the Revolution was
effected, supported the opposite side, which gave occasion
to the following epigrams:</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> J. Jane, son of the gentleman who kept the
school at Truro, became a student and tutor at Christ
Church, from whenee he retired to the college living of
Iron Acton in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>Truro has produced its fair proportion of men distinguished
by their proficiencies in literature, arts, sciences,
and arms. Of persons living, I would select the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Richard Polwhele, as an eminent historian, poet, and
divine; and the Right Honourable General Sir Hussey
Vivian, companion in arms of the Duke of Wellington,
an active partaker in the glories of Waterloo, since commander-in-chief
of Ireland, and now (1836) occupying,
perhaps, the highest office of the government not included
in the cabinet.</p>

<p>An individual, little if at all remembered, emanated
from Truro in the sixteenth century, if he was not born
there. Wood says, in the Athenæ Oxonienses:</p>

<p>“Thomas Farnabie, the most noted schoolmaster of his
time, son of Thomas Farnabie, of London, carpenter, son
of &mdash;&mdash; Farnabie, sometime Mayor of Truro in Cornwall,
was born in London about 1575, and became a Student of
Merton College in 1590; but being wild he made no long
stay there, but left the college very abruptly, and went
into Spain, and was for some time educated in a college
belonging to the Jesuits. He left them, however, and
being minded to take a ramble, went with Sir Francis
Drake and Sir John Hawkyns in their last voyage; afterwards,
it is said, he was a soldier in the Low Countries.
Having suffered great distress after his return, he at last
succeeded in establishing a school in Goldsmiths’ Rents,
near Red Cross Street in London, where at one time he
made up a number exceeding three hundred generous
<!--091.png--><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>
youths. At length, upon occasion of some sickness, he
removed about 1636 to Sevenoaks in Kent, in the neighbourhood
of which place (at Oxford) he had purchased an
estate, and taught there the sons of several neighbouring
gentlemen, by which he acquired considerable wealth, and
purchased another estate near Horsham in Sussex. He
suffered some loss and imprisonment in the Civil War on
account of his taking the Royalty side, and died at Sevenoaks,
where he is buried, in the chancel of the church,
with the following inscription:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“P. M. Viri ornatissimi Thomæ Farnabii Armigeri,
causæ olim Regiæ, reique publicæ, sed literariæ vindicis
acerrimi, obiit 12 Junii 1647.</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i0">“Vatibus hic sacris qui lux Farnabius olim,</div>
  <div class="i2">Vate carens saxo nunc sine luce jacet.”</div>
</div>

<p>His principal works are,</p>

<p>Notes on the Satyrs of Juvenal and Persius.</p>
<p class="p0">Notes on the Tragedies of Seneca.</p>
<p class="p0">Notes on Martial’s Epigrams.</p>
<p class="p0">Notes on Lucan’s Pharsalia.</p>

<p class="p0">Tables of the Greek Language.</p>
<p class="p0">Various Letters to Learned Persons.</p>

<p>Boyle says of him in his Dictionary, that Farnaby was
a learned classic, and that his notes on the greater part of
the ancient Latin Poets have been of much use to young
persons; that he dedicated his Horace to Prince Henry, the
eldest son of King James the First, and that he was most
favourably received by the Prince when he presented his
<!--092.png--><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
work; and that he received an order, or a request, to make
similar commentaries on all the Latin Poets, in anticipation,
in some degree, of the great work afterwards executed
for the King’s son in France.</p>

<p class="p2">But the most remarkable and striking feature in the history
of Truro consists of the great wealth acquired there
by various families in succession during a long series of
years.</p>

<p>The first on record is the family of Roberts, or Robartes, who
are said to have began their career by retail trade in a house
remaining at the commencement of this century, near the
north-western extremity of what has been made the great
street, by the improvement of taking down the middle row
of houses, noticed by Mr. Whitaker, and completed by a
new street leading from it southward towards Penryn and
Falmouth.</p>

<p>It is possible that the very humble commencement of the
Roberts’s fortunes may have been invented since their splendid
elevation, to augment the wonder; but certain it is, that
they resided for several generations in Truro, conducting
extensive mercantile concerns, and accumulating capital,
rather than obtaining it by any sudden effort; and employing
their savings in the acquirement of land by great or
small purchases, or more frequently, perhaps, through the
medium of advancing money on mortgage, till they acquired
the most scattered estate of any in the county. About the
reign of James the First, this family rose into high consideration;
they acquired an hereditary seat in Parliament,
in a manner not very honourable at least to the Duke of
Buckingham, and afterwards became decorated with the
nominal office of Earl of Radnor: held the Lord Lieutenancy
of Cornwall, with the Lord Wardenship of the Stannaries;
and, lastly, the office of highest dignity in the gift of
the Crown, the Vice-Royalty of Ireland.</p>

<p>The next considerable family emerging from Truro was
the Vincents; in their case the practice of law was added
<!--093.png--><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
to trade; they repeatedly represented Truro in Parliament,
and were among the first people of the county. One
of their seats was Tresimple in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s, now the
property of Mr. Vivian, of Penkalenick in the same
parish; but the family of Vincent has disappeared, and
their very memory is almost extinguished.</p>

<p>After the Vincents will come the Gregors, who have
now been for a long period country gentlemen. The late
Mr. Francis Gregor represented the county in three successive
Parliaments, from 1790 to 1806, when he retired on
account of ill health.</p>

<p>The next large fortune acquired at Truro was by Mr.
Lemon. A short account of this very extraordinary person
has been given under Germoe parish. His very splendid
career, not merely of acquiring wealth, but of high
reputation for himself and of benefit to his country, began in
the neighbourhood of Penzance; and his removal to Truro
is understood to have been occasioned by the discernment
of Mr. Coster, a gentleman concerned in copper smelting
works at Bristol, and a representative in Parliament for
that city.</p>

<p>Mr. Coster greatly augmented his fortune by purchasing
the copper ores of Cornwall, for some time without a competitor;
and undertaking to work some of the Gwennap
mines in depth for copper, which had previously been productive
of tin, he selected Mr. Lemon for one of his
partners, with unlimited confidence in managing the whole
concern.</p>

<p>Mr. Lemon was succeeded by Mr. Daniell, who took the
whole of his great mercantile concerns off the hands of
Mr. Lemon’s executors in 1760, having acquired the command
of capital by his marriage with Miss Elliot, niece of
Mr. Allen, of Bath. The late Mr. John Vivian acquired
also a large fortune residing in Truro; and of persons now
living, several might be added to the list.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Hussey has been noticed in the parish of
<!--094.png--><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
Feock as an eminent lawyer, and likely to have attained
some of the highest honours of the profession; he died unmarried
in 1770. His father, who practised in Truro as
an attorney, was the son of the Reverend John Hussey,
vicar of Okehampton in Devonshire.</p>

<p>The late Mr. John Thomas may also be included among
those who have acquired fortunes and displayed ability at
Truro: after retiring early in life to Chiverton, a paternal
property in Perran Zabuloe, where he built an excellent
house, Mr. Thomas was placed in the honourable office
of Vice-Warden, which he executed with great credit for
more than thirty years.</p>

<p>Among persons distinguished for talents, one cannot
omit Mr. Samuel Foote; he was born here about the year
1720, although the family seat was Lambessa, in the adjoining
parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement. His mother was the sister of
Sir John Dinely Goodere and of Samuel Goodere, a Captain
in the Navy, whose history almost equals in depth of
misery the well-known tragedy of Penryn; and it is a
curious circumstance that Mr. Foote’s first publication is a
complete narrative of this most melancholy affair, in a
pamphlet signed with his name, and addressed to Henry
Combe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> then Mayor of Bristol, in 1741. Mr. Foote’s
life and adventures are before the public in various forms.</p>

<p>Recently two natives of Truro have distinguished themselves
throughout Europe by a most important geographical
discovery. The Mr. Landers, as is well known, descended
a large river from the interior of Africa to the
sea, at what is called the Bite of Benin, where the river
loses itself by flowing in divided streams through a delta
created by the deposit of alluvial debris, brought down
from the highlands by the force of its own current.</p>

<p>A monument is now constructing on an elevated piece of
ground at the southern extremity of the town, in memory
of the brother, who has most unfortunately lost his life in
a second expedition, intended for the establishment of a
<!--095.png--><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
friendly and commercial intercourse with the inhabitants
of countries thus brought within our reach.</p>

<p>An anecdote seems worth preserving relative to an invention,
completely in anticipation of the use now made of
steam for propelling vessels in all parts of the world. The
mere idea of using this gigantic power instead of the
human arm for moving boats and ships through the water,
must have occurred to thousands; the mode of effecting
the application is the real invention.</p>

<p>About sixty years ago Mr. Charles Warrick resided at
Truro, a young man of some family and fortune, and bred
to the law; a person of singular and eccentric habits, displaying
much ability and genius in some cases, with an
apparent want of both in others. Mr. Warrick partook
of a taste very common in places situated on navigable
rivers, for spending a large portion of his time on the
water, or in making contrivances relative to navigation; and
he constructed a boat with slender ribs, covered either with
canvass or with paper soaked in substances that excluded
water: on each side he appended a wheel connected together
by an axis turned in the middle into the form of a
staple, or what is called a double crank. In this boat he
frequently paddled from Truro to Falmouth Harbour,
moving the crank with his hands, and out-running all other
boats; but no one thought of applying the construction to
larger vessels, nor had he, in all probability, the slightest
notion, that within half a century similar wheels and cranks,
moved by steam-engines, would impel vessels of many hundred
tons burden through the most tempestuous seas, and
against winds and tides, over extensive oceans, with a safety
and a precision almost equal to land conveyance.</p>

<p>As illustrative of the changes in all respects, that have
taken place in the last three-quarters of a century, the following
curious relation, although trifling in itself, may be
allowed to find a place.</p>

<p>A family about to embark at Falmouth, no longer ago
than the year 1748 or 1749, hired a coach and horses in
<!--096.png--><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
London to convey them there, a system of travelling practised
on the continent up to the present time; the driver
having delivered his charge, made known his desire for obtaining,
what he perhaps denominated a back-freight, on
easy terms, and a party of young men availed themselves
of the opportunity, stipulating, however, that in the event
of their reaching a town at any part of the day where cockfighting
would take place in the evening, the coach should
lie by to afford them an opportunity of being present at the
diversion.</p>

<p>Truro has not been measured as a distinct parish, and is
therefore included in Kenwyn.</p>

plainly shows here was an endowed rectory church dedicated
to her before that time. In the Inquisition of the
Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester, into the value of
Cornish Benefices, Ecclesia de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Tudy, in decanatu de

the incumbent Trelawny. This parish was
rated to the four shillings per pound Land Tax for one year,
by the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Udy, £144.</p>

<p>The history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Udith is as followeth: she was the
natural daughter of King Edgar, by the lady Wolfchild,
who was afterwards made Lady Abbess or mother of the
maids of the Nunnery of Wilton in Wiltshire, wherein
she demeaned herself so well as to her conduct, piety, and
purity, that, as Capgrave tells us, she obtained the reputation
of a saint, though the author of Polychronicon, Liber
6, chapter 9, tells us, that Bishop Ethel wold sharply
reproved her, for deviating from her rule, and being too
curious in her attire; to whom she replied that God regarded
the heart more than garments, and that sin might be
<!--098.png--><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
covered as well with rags as robes; to which the Bishop
answered, that, though our corrupt mortal bodies were
covered with silk, silver, and gold, it could neither procure
a minute’s life or health for us, nor hide our sins from God’s
sight, but were rather an argument of our pride and vanity,
than sincerity or humility.</p>

<p>After the brother of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Udith, Edward the Martyr, was
slain, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dunstan had a mind to make her Queen of England
to defeat Etheldred the lawful heir, but her piety or policy
would not permit her to accept the proffer: she died Anno
<abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 984, and was buried in the church of Denis of her
own building at Wilton. She is commonly called Udith
the younger, to distinguish her from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Udith her aunt.</p>

<p>Hengar was formerly the seat of the Billings, alias Trelanders,
whose daughter and heir was married to John
Trelawny of Coldrinick, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> by whom she had no issue;
after his decease she was married to Dr. Lower, Physician
in Ordinary to King Charles the Second, by whom he had
three daughters, one married to Edward Morice of Werrington,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> (by whom she had no issue); after his decease
she was married to the honourable Major-General Charles
Trelawny, governor of the Royal Citadel of Plymouth, now
in possession of this place. Another daughter was married
to Captain Mitchell; the third to &mdash;&mdash; Lower of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Winnow.</p>

<p>Pen-vos, alias Pen-vose. It is now the dwelling of
Humphrey Nicoll, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> Commissioner for the Peace, that
married &mdash;&mdash; Cudworth.</p>

<p>In this parish as I take it, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kew, is still to be seen
the ruins of a once famous and treble intrenchment of our
ancestors the Britains, called Dameliock Castle, and taxed
by the name of Dimelihoc, in the Domesday Book 1087,
wherein Gothlois, (i. e. purple back or spear,) Earl of Cornwall
immured or fortified himself against Uter Pendragon’s
soldiers: in which place he was by them slain about the
fifth century, as our annalists tell us (see Dundagell).</p>

<p>Damelyock, alias Daimelack, as a monosyllable in British,
<!--099.png--><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
Scotch, and Irish, signifies the hazard, skirmish, or
battle house or place. The lands about this fort and
castle, since its first erection, have been enclosed and cultivated,
so that now it is comparatively defaced, but not so
much as to obscure this treble ditch, camp, or intrenchment,
from the sight of spectators or observators, or to obliterate
its ancient name aforesaid; but query, whether this Dameliock
Castle be not in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kew and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Teath?</p>

<p>Those Billings, alias Trelawders, mentioned on the other
side, were gentlemen of blood and arms of three or four
descents, and at Hengar, alias Hanger or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn,
married with the daughters of Blewet of Colon (who gave
for their arms, Gules, a chevron between three eagles
displayed Vert), Babb of Tingraze in Devon, Hockyn of
Helland, and Helston in Cornwall, and gave for their own
arms, in a field Or, on a bend Sable three stag’s or buck’s
heads couped at the neck Or, attired and armed of the
Field. The which Billing, heir of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabin, was married
to Hamley of Treblethick 1630.</p>

<p>Note further, that Tredinick of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock gave the same
arms as Billing or Trelawder of Hengar, only differenced
with the colour of the stag’s or buck’s heads, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in a field

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church of this parish is adorned with several splendid
monuments, one to Mr. Anthony Nicoll, who distinguished
himself in the Civil War, and another representing a
mother and three daughters kneeling, with various arms
emblazoned over them, Reskymer, Courtenay, Mohun,
Trelawny, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Editha, the patroness of this church, as Mr. Hals
conjectures on the assumed authority of Domesday Book,
must have acquired a high degree of sanctity at a very
early period of life, having died in her twenty-fourth year,
after passing her time from childhood in the convent at
Wilton, of which her mother was abbess; and, therefore, as
it is observed in the Roman Martyrology, “She may be
said rather not to have known the world than to have left
it;” but she fasted, wore hair-cloth next her skin, and
chose to perform every office that was most disgusting or
loathsome. In recompense, her beatitude was attested,
according to William of Malmesbury, in a most decisive
manner; who says, that while Canute celebrated the festival
of Whitsuntide at Wilton, he spoke with ridicule of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Editha, adding, that he never could believe the daughter
<!--101.png--><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
of King Edgar could be a saint, who had always
addicted himself to acts of tyranny, and to the indulgence
of bad passions. Ethelnodus, the archbishop, then present,
contradicted the king, and proceeded to open the tomb of
the virgin saint; when, raising herself up so as to sit, she
seemed to attack the contumaceous king; and he, terrified,
fell prostrate on the ground, apparently without life; but
recovering, he expressed great joy, that by a renovation of
his existence he found himself in a situation to be penitent
for his fault.</p>

<p>The presentation to this rectory is in the Dean and
Canons of Christ Church. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Hodgson,
late student, presented in 1817, is the present incumbent.</p>

<p>The whole parish appears to be well cultivated, notwithstanding
that it adjoins the granite district of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breward
or Simonward, and it is agreeably diversified by hill and
dale.</p>

<p>It appears from Mr. Lysons that the manor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Tudy
belonged to the family of Nicoll, but that it was sold together
with Penrose, the family seat, to Mr. Trehawke of
Leskeard, by whom they have been devised to Samuel
Kekewich, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr></p>

<p>The manor of Tinten, like so many others, either gave its
name to the ancient proprietors, or received it from them.
An heiress took it to the Carminows of Boconnoc. The
Carminow property passed to the Courtenays, and fell to
the Crown on the attainder of the Marquis of Exeter. This
manor was included by King Henry the Eighth in the
exchange given for the honour of Wallingford.</p>

hills of the slate formation, deep valleys with streams of
water, and trees, and finally the sea. This place was the
occasional residence of Matthew Michell, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> acquired
under the will of Samuel Michell, a Colonel in the Guards,
who died there in 1786, after attaining his eighty-fifth

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Tywardreth is situate in the hundred of Powder, and
hath upon the north Lanlivery and Luxillian, south the
British Channel, east Giant and Fowey Town, west <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Blazey. The name signifieth the house upon the sand; and
by the same name of Tywardrai, it was taxed in the Domesday
Book 1087. In the inquisition of the Bishops of
Lincoln and Winchester into the value of Cornish Benefices
1294, Ecclesia de Tywardreth, in decanatu de Powdre,
was valued at <abbr title="106">cvi</abbr><span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
<abbr title="eight">viii</abbr><span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>; in Wolsey’s Inquisition
1521, £9. 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>; the patronage formerly in the abbat of
Tywardreth, now Rashleigh; the incumbent &mdash;&mdash; Woolridge;
the rectory in Rashleigh; and the parish rated to
the four shillings per pound Land Tax 1696, for one year
£205. This church is wholly appropriated or impropriated
to the prior or abbat of Tywardreth, before the statute of
Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; and the vicar was paid only with £11 modus
or stipend per annum, out of the Duchy Exchequer of
Lestwithiel. It was the chief alien priory in those parts,
which name of alien priors or abbats arose soon after the
Norman Conquest, when certain Englishmen, Normans,
and French, gave lands in England to Monasteries beyond
the seas; upon which the monks built convenient houses
<!--104.png--><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
for increasing the number of those under their own rule,
and to inspect their revenues and tithes, in which houses
they planted a suitable number of monks, under a superior
or steward. This priory or abbey was therefore accordingly
made subject to the Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sergius and Bacchus of
Angiers in France, soon after the Norman Conquest (to
whom also is dedicated their church of Luxillian).</p>

<p>The history of whom is as followeth: These saints were
Christians and Noblemen of the City of Constantinople;
the one Primicerius, and the other Secondicerius; that is
to say, Sergius the First, and Bacchus the Second, Secretaries
of State to the Emperor Maximian; who for that
they would not join with him in sacrificing to the Roman
gods or idols, were cruelly tormented by the common
hangman, and lastly had their heads chopped off, 7th
October 310. There is pious mention of those saints in
the Second Nicene Council, Martyrologers, and otherwise;
and many churches are dedicated to them in Constantinople,
and other parts of Christendom; and the place in
Asia where <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sergius suffered, is called Sergiopolis to
this day.</p>

<p>This abbey was first founded by William Earl of Morton
and Cornwall, according to the rule of Augustine and
Benedict. It was afterwards re-edified and greatly augmented
in its revenues by Robert de Cardinham, tempore
Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1190, (see the Monasticon Anglicanum of
Dugdale); for which reason he is by some persons taken
to be the founder thereof.</p>

<p>This Robert de Cardinham I take to be the same person
mentioned by the name of Robert de Cardinam, (Survey
Cornwall, page 44), who held by the tenure of knight
service seventy-one knight’s fees of Morton in Cornwall,
tempore Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p>This abbey or priory house and church of Tywardreth,
was dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew the Apostle and Martyr of
Christ, whose history followeth. He was born at Bethsaida
in the province of Galilee, elder brother of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter,
<!--105.png--><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
and disciple of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John Baptist, and was present when he
pointed at Jesus, saying, “Behold the Lamb of God that
taketh away the sins of the world;” whereupon he left <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John Baptist and followed Christ. Who, for that, after
our Saviour’s Crucifixion, he would not sacrifice to the
Roman Gods or Idols, at the command of Egeus Proconsul
of Rome, sent governor into the province of Achaia,
was crucified as his Lord and Master was, 30 November,
Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 60, in the reign of the Emperor Nero.</p>

<p>His body was afterwards translated to Constantinople,
from thence to Italy, and lastly to Amalphy in Naples,
where it still remains.</p>

<p class="p2">Now, by reason these alien priories transmitted to their
superiors beyond the seas the news and state of affairs in
this land, whereby the designs and undertakings of our
princes were divulged to their enemies in their French
wars; therefore all those sort of religious houses of this
kind were suppressed by Act of Parliament, tempore
Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> and Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>; and
amongst them in Cornwall, Minster, alias Tolcarne, in
Trigmajor, and Minster in Kerryer; <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Bennett’s in Lanyvet in Pider were put down, and their
lands confiscated to the Crown; but this priory of Tywardreth,
for its loyalty or integrity, or for some other reason of
security, stood firm till the general dissolution of all those
religious houses, 26 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> when the revenues of this
abbey, according to Dugdale, was £123. 9<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 3<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> Speed
£151. 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> as is set down in their Monasticon Anglicanum.</p>

<p>Mena-belly, alias Mena-billy, in this parish, is the dwelling
of Jonathan Rashleigh, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> Commissioner for the
Peace and Taxes, and some time Member of Parliament
for Fowey, that married Carew of Anthony, his father
Sawle, his grandfather Bonython, his great-grandfather
Lanyon. Originally descended and denominated from the

local place of Rashleigh house, in or about Raneleigh
parish in Chulmleigh Hundred in Devon.</p>

<p>In this parish, towards the sea coast, is that famous camp
or treble intrenchment, called Castle Dore, consisting of a
threefold trench cast up of earth, in which heretofore our
ancestors the Britons fortified themselves against their
enemies; out of which, as common report saith, tempore
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> some dreamers of money hid in this camp or
place, upon search made, accordingly found such treasure
as they much enriched themselves thereby.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Trewardreth is in the hundred of Powder; for the name,
it signifies the village or the house upon the sand. It is a
vicarage, not valued in the King’s Book, as having been
but lately endowed; the late incumbent was Mr. May,
likewise Rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mewan, who died this year (1732).</p>

<p>In the year 1291, 20th Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> the rectory of this
church was valued at £5. 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> being appropriated to the
priory here; and the vicarage at 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span></p>

<p>In 3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> William de Campo Arnulphi [or Champernoun]
held here one fee, from whom the prior held three
acres and a half in the same. There are what are still called
the priory lands. But to go further back, as Robert de
Cardinam was the founder of this priory in the time of
Richard the First, according to Bishop Tanner in his
Notitia Monastica, this must be one of the seventy knight’s
fees, which the said Robert held in this county, 6th Richard
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr> who by consequence must then have been lord of this
manor. In Domesday Book it is, by the name of Tiwardrai,
numbered among the manors which William the Conqueror
gave to Robert Earl of Morton, when he made
him Earl of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Leland says of this place, Tywardreth, “A praty town,
but no market, lieth a quarter of a mile from the east side of
the bay; there is a parish church, and there was a priory
<!--107.png--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
of black monks, a cell sometime to a house in Normandy.
Some say Campernulphus was founder of this priory; some
say that Cardinham was founder. Arundell of Lanherne
was of late taken for the founder.</p>

<p>“I saw a tomb in the west part of the church of this
priory, with this inscription:</p>

<p class="center" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hæc est Tumba<br />
Roberti filii Wilhelmi.</p>

<p>“This Robert Fitz William was a man of fair lands,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tempore Edwardi tertii Regis Angliæ</span>.”</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The parish church and tower bear on the exterior an
appearance of antiquity. Internally, much decoration was
displayed, and especially by a rood-loft which has been
recently taken down. These alterations of our ancient
churches are justly lamented by all persons capable of
admiring the beauty and imposing splendour of Gothic
architecture, but they seem to have almost inevitably grown
out of the change of purpose to which churches are applied.
Originally, the chancel, protected by the rood loft and by a
veiled entrance, was destined for the astounding miracle of
repeatedly transforming bread and wine into the actual
body and blood of Christ, while the outward or less sacred
part of the edifice, was used for processions and scenic
exhibitions; accompanied by dirges or by triumphant
choruses, adapted either to the death or to the resurrection
of our Saviour. In modern times, on the contrary, a room
is required so constructed as to admit of whole congregations
joining with an individual in prayers, or of listening
to his instruction.</p>

<p>The monastery has so completely disappeared, that its
precise locality was not remembered; but a gentleman of
the neighbourhood having taken considerable pains to
<!--108.png--><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
ascertain whatever could yet be discovered about it, made
the following communication to the Gentleman’s Magazine
in 1822.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The ancient priory of Tywardreth has long been so
entirely levelled with the ground, that it is not very easy
even to ascertain its site. Some time ago the present vicar
obtained leave to dig the ground on its supposed site in
search of stones for erecting a vicarage house. The place
where he made an excavation for this purpose appears to
have been the east end of the priory chapel; and as some
measurements were taken at the time, and I have, with the
permission of the landlord, opened the ground in several
places, partly with the hope of ascertaining the form of the
chapel, and partly of throwing some light on its architecture,
the following particulars may not be unacceptable.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The chapel appears, so far as could be ascertained by
measurement, to have been eighty feet long, by fifty-seven
wide, with a semicircular end towards the east, strengthened
by four buttresses of wrought Pentewan stone, two feet
wide, and ornamented by four pilasters; within the shafts
are a single half-column, fourteen inches in diameter. At
each angle was a handsome piece of architecture, as it was
described to me, of which pilasters, resembling those
already described, formed a part, but with the base five
inches wide, and the mouldings in proportion.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In the vicarage garden, adjoining the west end of the
chapel, a fragment of a stone arch was found, with a fleur-de-lis
elegantly carved in deep relief; the same devise
appears on the church stile, and in a coat of arms in one of
the windows of the church, and appears from Tanner to
have been part of the arms of the priory. The wall of the
chapel is the south wall of the churchyard.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The chapel was paved with beach pebbles, and was built
partly of common clay slate raised on the spot; the wrought
stones were of compact hard porphyry, from Pentewan
Quarry in the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, and hornblende from
the cliff between Duporth and Charlestown in the same
<!--109.png--><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
parish. All the carved work is executed with much skill
and taste.”</p>

<p>Several charters granted to this monastery are preserved
in Dugdale’s Monasticon. The earliest is in the 19th
year of Henry the Third, A. D. 1234, as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Henricus Dei gratia Rex Angliæ, Dominus Hiberniæ
Dux Normandiæ et Aquitaniæ, et Comes Andegaviæ, omnibus
Archiepiscopis, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> salutem. Inspeximus cartam
Roberti de Cardinam, in hæc verba:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Robertus de Cardinam omnibus Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ
filiis salutem. Sciatis me, pro Dei amore et animæ meæ
salute, concessisse et præsenti carta mea confirmasse ecclesiæ
sanctorum martyrum, Sergii et Bachi Andegavi, et
ecclesiæ Sancti Andreæ de Tywordrait et Monachis ibidem
Deo servientibus et servituris, omnes donationes et concessiones
quas antecessores mei, seu quicunque fideles de
feodo meo ipsis fecerint,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>The seal of the convent is understood to have been a
saltire, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew’s cross Or, between four fleurs-de-lis,
which accounts for the sculptures noticed above.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew became the patron saint of Scotland, and
popular throughout the whole island, after an Abbat, said
to have borne the name of Regulus, had brought some of
his relics to a place then called Abernethy, but where a
Monastery, a University, and a city, have since arisen to
commemorate the Apostle.</p>

<p>The priory of Tywardreth appears to have been suppressed
with the other alien houses, but afterwards to
have been re-established as an independent society, or made
denizen according to the legal phrase, having at the time
of the general dissolution the Priory of Minster attached
to it as a cell, which had been originally dependent with
itself on the Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sergius and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bacchus at Angiers,
the former capital of Anjou, and now of the department
of the Maine and Loire.</p>

<p>A very curious correspondence between Thomas Cromwell,
Vicar-General and Vicegerent of the King’s Supremacy
on the one part, and Thomas Collyns the last Prior
<!--110.png--><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
on the other, is said to exist among the papers and documents
preserved by the Arundells of Lanhearn, and of
Wardour Castle in Wiltshire.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of the letters Cromwell is understood to have
complimented the Prior on the possession of every active
virtue, especially as displayed in the good government of
his convent; he assures him that the King is fully sensible of
his merits; and in consideration of his great age and faithful
services, the King out of special grace and favour would
allow him not only to resign the painful office of governing
such a society, but would admit of his recommending a successor.</p>

<p>Collyns’s answer is full of thanks to the Lord Vicegerent,
and of gratitude to the King, whose approbation he esteemed
above all worldly matters, and next to the conscious satisfaction
of having discharged faithfully his duties towards
the Almighty in the station to which it pleased God that,
without any merits of his own, he should be advanced.
He offered his most humble and grateful thanks to
the King for the great favours profferred to him; but that,
feeling his health and strength sufficient for enabling him to
continue the discharge of duties which the King had
approved, he owed it to his conscience not to withdraw
from them.</p>

<p>This brought a letter from Cromwell, declaring that the
horrible savour of his sins, his crimes, and his iniquities
had ascended before the Lord; and that, unless he immediately
relinquished an office which he had most grossly
abused, an ecclesiastical commission would proceed to
inquire into his misdeeds, and to punish him accordingly.
This latter is understood to have produced either an immediate
surrender of the priory, or Collyns’s resignation preparatory
to it. He was elected in 1506, and died in 1539,
as appears from his tombstone in the chancel.</p>

<p><!--111.png--><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
The site of this priory was granted in 1542 to Edward
Seymour, then Earl of Hertford, afterwards Duke of
Somerset, and Protector. It subsequently became the joint
property of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyns and the Pendarveses of Roscrow.
The late Lord Dunstanville inherited the latter
portion, and acquired the former by purchase.</p>

<p>It seems that a manor of Tywardreth, which in early
times must have been paramount over the others, passed
from Ricardus Dapifer to the Cardinhams. Mr. Lysons
says it was sold towards the latter part of the 13th century,
by Isolda de Cardinham to the Champernownes, for a
hundred pounds. From this family it passed to the Herles
and Bonvilles, and fell to the Crown on the attainder of the
Duke of Suffolk in 1554. It belonged to the family of
Rashleigh, in the early part of the subsequent century; with
whom it still remains, including the entire impropriation
of the great and small tithes.</p>

<p>Menabilly has been the seat of that distinguished family
for a period of at least two hundred years. At the last
visitation of the Heralds in 1620, Jonathan Rashleigh of
Fowey, who married Alice, daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Bonithan
of Kertleowe, is said to be alive, having two sons. The
eldest John Rashleigh, aged 34, and Jonathan Rashleigh
the second. John Rashleigh, ancestor of these two brothers,
in the fifth degree, is stated to have been of Barnstaple.</p>

<p>Individuals of this family have represented Fowey during
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Charles the First, Charles
the Second, and King William; and since the accession of
King George the Second, up to very recent times, scarcely
a Parliament has been assembled that could not count a
Rashleigh among its members.</p>

<p>Mr. Jonathan Rashleigh was elected Member for Fowey
in 1728, and continued to represent that town in eight
successive Parliaments, and in the last with his eldest son.</p>

<p>This gentleman married Mary, daughter of Sir William
Clayton of Surrey, and died in 1764, leaving a very numerous
family, all of whom have been distinguished as persons
<!--112.png--><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
of ability, of integrity, and of honour, followers of the best
advice said ever to have been given by a parent.</p>

<div class="poem" lang="el" xml:lang="el">
  <div class="i0">Αιεν αριστευειν, και ὑπειροχον εμμεναι αλλων,</div>
  <div class="i0">Μηδε γενος πατερων αισχυνεμεν.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Philip Rashleigh, the eldest brother, represented
Fowey during a length of time almost equal to that of his
father. He greatly improved the family seat, but especially
distinguished Menabilly by placing there the most extensive
and magnificent collection of Cornish minerals, enriched by
others from every part of the known world, that could any
where be seen. And Mr. Rashleigh has given to the
public, in two thin quarto volumes, fifty-three coloured
plates, with descriptions of the most choice or rare specimens.
The work is entitled, “Specimens of British
Minerals, selected from the Cabinet of Philip Rashleigh,
with general descriptions of each article,” printed by
Bulmer and Co. the first volume in 1797, and the
second in 1802. At the end of the second volume is
added a Geological Plate, being a section of the stream
work at Porth in the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey, about a quarter
of a mile from high water-mark, containing the position
and measurement of ten distinctly marked deposits, with
subdivisions, accompanied by descriptions of each; the
whole extending to a depth of 44 feet: and what adds to
the value of this section, the stream work was destroyed by
a very high tide about the period when the volume was
published.</p>

<p>In addition to this scientific collection, Mr. Rashleigh
constructed a grotto at some distance from the house,
encrusted on the inside by some common but splendid
minerals, exhibiting also the position of lodes, their heaves,
their slides, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and this was liberally thrown open to all
persons applying for admission.</p>

<p>Mr. Rashleigh married very late in life, and dying without
children, left his ample estate to William, the eldest
son of his next brother, the Reverend Jonathan Rashleigh,
Rector of Silverton in Devonshire.</p>

<p><!--113.png--><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">109</span>
Mr. William Rashleigh succeeded his uncle in the
representation of Fowey, but voluntarily retired from
public life to enjoy domestic happiness, with the esteem and
regard of every one who has good fortune to be numbered
among his acquaintances.</p>

<p>Polkerris, a small harbour near Menabilly, as indeed is
indicated by the first syllable of the name, has been improved,
perhaps as a matter of fancy, by the Rashleigh
family. Mr. Jonathan Rashleigh built a pier capable of
giving shelter to coasting vessels and boats; and his son
the late Mr. Philip Rashleigh continued a sean fishery
for the benefit of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Kilmarth, which formerly belonged to a family called
Baker, is also the property of Mr. Rashleigh; the house is
placed on a very elevated piece of ground near the road
leading from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell to Fowey.</p>

<p>Treveryan once belonged to a branch of the Courtenays:
it passed by a purchase to John Thomas, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> by
whom the house was built. Mr. Thomas devised it to the
Reverend John Thomas Thomson, who died at Penzance
in 1811; and the estate now belongs to his son Henry
Thomson, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> resident at Lostwithiel, a magistrate, and
late a captain in the Cornwall militia.</p>

<p>Tywardreth measures 2967 statute acres.</p>

GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The extreme northern part of this parish, in an angular
form, extends upon the granite, surrounded on all sides by
the granite of Lanlivery. The remaining parts of the
parish are composed of schistose rocks, which next the
granite are of the porphyritic series, but become of a doubtful
nature in the southern extremity; these latter belong
perhaps to the calcareous series, as do also some of the
rocks in the adjoining parish of Fowey. The felspathic
rocks next the granite, like those of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, are metalliferous,
as is proved by the important mines of Lanescot
and Fowey Consols.</p>

whom William Earl of Morton built and first endowed it.</p>

<p>In the Domesday Book 1087, this district was taxed

<p>In this parish is the priory called Carock <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pill, in
which place William Earl of Morton and Cornwall founded
and endowed an house of Cluniac monks, and dedicated
the same to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sergius.</p>

<p>In this cell of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Syriac lived that celebrated author
Walter de Exeter, a Benedictine Monk 1292, as Isaack in
his Memorials of Exeter calls him, with greater probability
than that he was a Dominican friar, as Bale saith, or a
Franciscan friar as Mr. Carew tells us (Survey of Cornwall,
page 59); who, at the request of Baldwin of Exeter, writ
the life of Guy Earl of Warwick, who was the son of
Syward Baron of Wallingford, and married Felicia, daughter
and heir of Rohand Earl of Warwick; which Guy, at
the request of King Athelstan, fought a combat with Colbrand
the Danish giant, and slew him, since which time his
valour and conduct hath been very famous.</p>

<p>And Walter of Exeter for this book, and his skill in other
histories, hath by Bale given him this character:&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In
historiarum cognitione non fuit ultimus,”</span> that he was none
of the meanest historians of his time; though Mr. Carew
saith he only deformed the history of Guy of Warwick.</p>

<p>The house and chapel aforesaid, except the windows, is
now quite dilapidated, the burying place made a garden,
and a new dwelling house erected near it with the stones
thereof on its barton lands, now pertaining to the heirs of
Carter and Sillye. The fee-farm rent of £5 per annum is
paid to the king or prince, and is exempted from payment
of tithes.</p>

<p>The church of this parish is situated on an elevated
ridge of land, and is therefore conspicuous to a considerable
distance. It contains several monuments, and in the
churchyard is a memorial of Nicholas Courtenay, one of
the family to whom lands in this parish, parcel of Montacute
priory, were granted by King Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>There are two places in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Veep especially deserving of
attention. One the site of an ancient monastery constituted
on the smallest scale.</p>

<p>Tanner has given a list of the various names by which
this little priory appears to have been called in early times.
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Syriac, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ciriac, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Carricius, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kerrocus, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Cyret, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Julette. It was a small cell of two monks
only, dependent on Montacute; and being mentioned by
Gervase of Canterbury, it is known to have existed at the
least so early as the time of King Richard the First.</p>

<p>The church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Currie, or Karentocus, was given to
the monks of Montacute by their founder.</p>

<p><!--117.png--><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
This cell occurs but once in Pope Nicholas’s Taxation.</p>

<p>Prior de Sancto Karabo (or by a various reading <abbr title="Sancto">S<sup>to</sup>.</abbr>

<p>In the valuation returned to King Henry the Eighth,
and preserved in the Augmentation Office, this small establishment
is said to possess a revenue of £11. 1<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span></p>

<p>It appears to have been valued as a separate house from
the parent establishment, although the return states, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cella
Sancti Kaboci in comitatu prædicto, dicto Prioratui de
Monte Acuto appertinens, unde Laurencius Castelton est
Prior, est dative et removabile dicti Prioris de Monte
Acuto.</span></p>

<p>The site was granted in the 37th of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> as
parcel of the possessions of Montacute, to Laurence Courtenay.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cyric’s Creek, by which this house stood, is said to
have derived its name from a saint so called, who was buried
there, perhaps in the very place where the small monastery
stood. The place has long since acquired the appellation of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cadix; it belongs to the coheiresses of the family of
Wymond.</p>

<p>It is certainly a curious circumstance, that a work which
engaged the attention and even the admiration of England
for a long period of years, should have emanated in any
way from a remote cell, consisting of two monks. Mr.
Carew assigns 1292 for the date of this work; but Mr.
Warton says, in his History of English Poetry, that a life
of Guy Earl of Warwick was written by Giraldus Cambrensis,
who died about the year 1220; but the history of
our renowned champion has been composed in Norman
French, and in old English, both in prose and in verse;
moreover, the first part of the romance describing the
adventures of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">preux chevalier</i> combating <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la outrance</i>
to recommend himself to the favour of his lady love, is
clearly by a different hand, and even of another age from
the second part, which represents him deserting the idol of
<!--118.png--><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
his affection; journeying to Palastine; and on his arrival
back to England, instead of repairing to Warwick Castle,
the abode and rich inheritance of his wife the Lady Felicia,
retiring to a cell, and taking alms at the castle gate, on the
supposition that a powerful and malignant demon, the creation
of perverted imagination in those times of ignorance,
and blasphemously named after the Divinity, might be
propitiated by such disgusting observances, and by human
misery. The monk of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cyric may therefore have
blended, enlarged, abridged, versified, or rendered into
prose the achievements of Sir Guy, and his performance
may have been peculiarly suited to the taste of his age.</p>

<p>The second place to be noticed is Trevelyan, the original
seat of the very ancient and respected family that has
resided for the last three hundred years at Nettlecombe in
Somersetshire, which they acquired by a marriage with the
heiress of Whalesborowe. The names of Whalesborough
and of Trevelyan occur among the Sheriffs of Cornwall
in the time of the Plantagenets, and also together as representatives
of the county; and the name of Trevelyan may
be found in the same lists for the county of Somerset. It
is extraordinary that of this ancient seat one half only
belongs to the family. It would almost suggest the suspicion
of the other part being lost from want of attention, when
the intercourse between distant places was interrupted by
difficulties unknown to modern travellers. Few traces
remain of the ancient mansion.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons notices several manors in this parish, with
their descents or sales, but without any thing that can make
them interesting, except perhaps the notice that a manor
called Manely Coleshill formed a part of the ample estate
possessed by Lord Chief Justice Trevilyan.</p>

<p>Mr. Howell and Mr. Rashleigh are proprietors. The
advowson of the vicarage is divided, and in private
patronage.</p>

<p>It is said that the cavalry commanded by King Charles

the First was stationed at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Veep when the infantry of
the opposite army capitulated at Fowey. This station was
probably selected for the purpose of preventing a retreat
to Plymouth; which however the cavalry effected by passing
the river some miles higher up, but not without much
blame attaching to many officers on the royalist side, and
especially to General Goring.</p>

<p>But the antient name of this parish was Elerky, and so
it is still called in the King’s Book, as it is too in Taxatio
<abbr title="Beneficiorum">Benefic.</abbr> 20 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> “Ecclesia de Elerky 10 <abbr title="liber">lib.</abbr> vicar’

<p class="p2 center small">MANOR OF ELERKY.</p>

<p>In Domesday Book it is called Elerchi, which signifies
the swan’s house or swannery; for Elerk in Cornish is a
swan, and there are the remains of a large pool under the
house, which seems to have been designed to that end.</p>

<p>It is in the said book inserted among the manors given
by William the Conqueror, to his half-brother Robert
Earl of Morton and Cornwall.</p>

<p>Francis Tregian, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> among the rest of his estates,
forfeited his half of this manor.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">WHITAKER.</p>

<p>The original name of this parish was the same with the
name of the manor Elerchi, or Elerky; that the appellation
of the manor in Domesday Book, this in the present time,
and both derived from the manerial house. This house
stood upon a rising ground, nearly opposite to the church,
and on the west of it, which is now covered with several
houses of a mean condition, and yet marked as something
considerable to the eye, by a grove of tall trees upon it.
The great house, which the ancestors of these trees shaded,
has been long down, I suppose; and the mean houses on
the ground have been constructed of the poorest remains of
it. It was bounded on the south by the lane leading down
<!--123.png--><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">119</span>
to its own mills, still called Elerky Mills, and distinctively
noted as higher and lower; and on the east and north by
its lively brook, without a name, that divides the glebe from
the manor, then environs the house, and finally runs to the
two mills below. The manor is accordingly noticed so late
as the 5th of Charles the First, to have two mills within it.
These mills even now proclaim their original relation to
each other, by the restrictions which the higher is under to
the lower, in not being able to keep up the water from the
other, beyond a certain space of time. And the house thus
environed by the brook could not have been very small, as
it was the mansion of a district, which in the 12th of Edward
the First was reckoned at forty-two acres, when so
many are valued in much less, and when so few are valued
in more; but whence is the original name of this house
derived? Mr. Tonkin derives it from Elerk (C.) a swan,
and makes Elerky to signify the swannery, adding, that
“there are the remains of a large pool under the house,
which seems to have been designed to that end.” In all
that part of antiquarian researches where the eye is to be
assisted by the imagination, and the past to be collected
from the broken appearances of the present; every active
and lively mind is apt to cry out against the creative fancies
of the antiquarian poet, and to exclaim in the language of
Shakspeare,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash; As imagination bodies forth</div>
  <div class="i0">The form of things unseen, the Poet’s pen</div>
  <div class="i0">Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing</div>
  <div class="i0">A local habitation and a name.</div>
</div>

<p>But this spirit of exclamation should be checked. What
depends in any degree upon imagination, may by minds
without imagination be easily turned into ridicule. What
is only to be inferred by slow and painful collation of circumstances,
will be ridiculed at once by those who are too
brisk to be slow, and too lively to take pains. And the
very ingeniousness of antiquaries themselves, will at times
<!--124.png--><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
be a snare to them also, by inducing them to cut short the
labour of investigation, to ridicule the dull laboriousness of
conjecturing industry, and to leap over the difficulty which
it will not take the trouble to remove. On the whole,
therefore, I think Mr. Tonkin’s etymology of Elerky to be
the only one which is easy and natural, and his reference to
“remains of a large pool under the house,” to be sufficiently
grounded. There has evidently been something of the
kind there. A little dam below would easily make one
now. The remains were probably more in Mr. Tonkin’s
time than they now are. And these corroborating, and
corroborated by the positive import of Eala, (I.) Alarch
(W.) and Elerk, Elerchy (C.) a swan, and the undoubted
signification of the latter when thus combined Elerch Chy
(C.) for a swan’s house, compel us to adopt the etymon.</p>

<p>But this name has been entirely superseded in popular
use by the name of the saint. So much was the spiritual
patron of a church considered and talked of, that his name
was used to the total neglect of the other. But who was
the saint of this church? Symphorian, says Mr. Tonkin;
and Mr. Tonkin is right. It seems odd indeed to suppose
such a corruption of a name as this; Symphorian changed
into Veryan. But we see in Leland, (<abbr title="Itinerary, two">Itin. ii</abbr>, 112), that
the parish of Trevenny at Tintagel in this county, “is of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Symphorian, ther caullid Simiferian.” This is exactly
in point. Symphorian was called in this parish, as well as
in Trevenny, Simiforian or Simiferian, in order to accommodate
it more to our liquified pronunciation. It would
then be sure to be abridged soon, for the more rapid
pronunciation of it, by leaving out the first half of the name,
and taking only the last, just as Elizabeth is popularly
abbreviated into Bet. The name would thus be Phorian,
Ferian, Voryan, or Verian; as we have an estate in the
parish before, denominated Tre-Veryan, and as the ordinary
appellation of the parish is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Veryan in a record
above, and in common conversation Veryan. And the
time of observing the parish feast coincides with all, and
<!--125.png--><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
confirms it; Symphorian, of Autun in Burgundy, having
suffered martyrdom the <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> of August; and the feast in
honour of his martyrdom being observed accordingly.
Eight years ago the feast was agreed, for the sake of the
harvest, to be postponed one month; as, upon the same
principle, the memory of the parishioners says, it had been
previously postponed one fortnight. It is now kept on the
first Sunday in October, was previously kept on the first in
September, and originally on the third Sunday in August.</p>

<p>Nor can the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Symphrogia, or Simprosia,
which is said to occur as the title of the parish “in many
fines, records, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>” be any thing else than a corruption of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Symphorian. And as a full evidence, I find the picture
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Veryan and his wife were within memory to be seen
in the eastern window of the church.</p>

<p>The square tower of Veryan church appears from its
position on the side of the church, and at the south-western
end of the chancel, to have been an addition to the church.
After the lord had deserted Elerkey for Ruan, the lord’s
chapel was lengthened out into a belfry, with a tower over
it. The architecture of this tower seems to a passing eye
different from that of the church itself. And within, I
doubt not, evident traces will appear on examination, of
the posteriority of the tower to the church.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>There is very little to add respecting Veryan. Mr. Lysons
states that the manor of Elerkey, which gave its secular
name to the parish, now lost in that of the patron saint,
belonged with Ruan Lanihorne to the family of Archdeknes,
from them it passed to the Lucys and Vaux, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
and that it was finally purchased by the late Mr. Francis
Gregor in 1790.</p>

<p>The Dean and Chapter of Exeter have the great tithes,
and they are patrons of the vicarage; and, what is perhaps
without example in reference to so fluctuating a body, three

<p class="p2 center small">THE GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>This extensive and interesting parish is entirely situated
within the boundaries of the calcareous series. The prevailing
rock is a blue argillaceous slate, the surface of which,
when perfect, is either glossy and irridescent, or finely
striated: it alternates with several kinds of massive or
coarsely lamellar rocks, into which it gradually passes.
These rocks present the following varieties: a fine grained
rock abounding in scales of mica; a variety of greenstone
or cornean quartz rocks; and dark-coloured limestone.</p>

<p>This suite of rocks offers many objects worthy of a minute
inquiry, far beyond the limits of these short notices.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">
<!--127.png--><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>A very excellent account is given of the Veryan limestone
by S. J. Trist, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> in the first volume of the Transactions
of the Geological Society of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Mr. Trist says,</p>

<p class="blockquote">The limestone occurs on the coast at Pendower Beach,
and may thence be traced for a mile and a half inland.</p>

<p class="blockquote">It comes to the surface, in three different places, nearly
equidistant from each other, but at different elevations, the
most inland being probably a hundred and twenty, or
thirty feet above the level of the sea. In each instance it
creeps out at the brow of a hill, and no where appears in
the vale below, where it would seem originally to have
stretched across the valleys, but to have been subsequently
carried away, together with the accompanying matter, by
diluvian action.</p>

<p class="blockquote">In breadth it extends over a superficies of 350 yards, but
alternates with an argillaceous schist, the lime itself never
exceeding three feet in thickness, and that only in the
upper beds of the strata. The lime scarcely amounts
altogether to one eighth of the whole mass.</p>

<p class="blockquote">According to an analysis made by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William
Gregor, a good specimen of this stone consists of about nine
parts in ten of carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>Mr. Trist then gives a comparative statement of the
results from calcining this limestone, and the well-known
limestone of Plymouth, that 200 Winchester bushels of
lime from the kiln, provincially called shells or foreright
lime, are produced from 11 tons of the Veryan limestone,
by the consumption of 46 Winchester bushels of culm,
more universally known as Welsh stone coal; but that 14½
tons are required of the Plymouth limestone to give the
same quantity of lime from the kiln, with the consumption
of 56 bushels of culm, which would make the Plymouth
limestone inferior to that of Veryan, in about 32 per cent.
<!--128.png--><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
as to quality, and about 22 per cent. more in regard to
fuel. As a cement, its quality is remarkably good. Small
spherical masses of oxide of iron occur in great abundance;
they are, in the opinion of Mr. Gregor, pyrites in a state
of decomposition, the sulphur having escaped.</p>

<p>The colour of the rock is blue, and it is frequently traversed
by veins of calcareous spar.</p>

<p>In the schist which immediately reposes on the limestone,
mica appears in considerable abundance, and the whole is
strongly impregnated with lime. It is of a soft crumbling
nature, decomposing on exposure to the atmosphere, and in
that state it is much esteemed as a manure.</p>

<p>The floor on which the lime rests (probably the whole
alternating formation) is an argillaceous schist, with veins
of manganese, which have been partially wrought.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. Greenough has laid down on his map a broad line
extending about E. N. E. from Gerrans and Veryan,
crossing <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blasey Bay and ending near Looe, with the
inscription, “calcareous matter along this line”.</p>

<p>The true name of this parish is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Warbury-stow, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Warbury’s Place, from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Warbury alias Warburg. She
was the daughter of Wolpher King of Mercia, son to
the famous Penda. The church celebrates her memory the
21st of June, a holy virgin, to whom Leofrick dedicated
a church in Chester, which Hugh Lupus, the first earl of
Chester of the Norman blood, repaired and granted to the
monks, and it is now the cathedral there. [N. B. a Saxon
Saint in Cornwall, introduced by the Saxons on their early
settlement on this eastern and detached part of Cornwall.]
This [church] is now attached to Treneglos, and passes in
the same presentation; the present incumbent being Mr.
Charles Porter.</p>

<p>In this parish is a noble fortification, which perhaps
might give occasion of dedicating it to such a Saint as carried
it with it such a warlike sound [or, as the fact assuredly
is, the fortification was called Warborough, and the parish
from it, Warborough-stow or Warbstow. W.] I measured,
and took a more particular view of it than I had formerly
done, this present year 1731.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>This part of Cornwall abounds in military antiquities,
but it has been far less carefully examined than other districts
<!--130.png--><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
of the county; judging from the present aspect of the
country, one is induced to wonder that camps or fortresses
should ever have been established there, or that stationary
armies could by possibility have received support.</p>

<p>The Editor recollects having seen the entrenchment
many years ago; that it struck him as much resembling the
Roman works in Dorsetshire; and as being of dimensions
far more extensive than those of the usual earthworks in
Cornwall.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Walburge, the patroness of this parish, was the
daughter of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Richard, a King of the West Saxons, who
is said to have died at Lucca in the year 722, on his way as
a pilgrim to Rome.</p>

<p>His daughter having become a nun in the monastery at
Wimbourn Minster, was permitted by the Abbess Testa to
depart with several other females who had taken the vows,
for the purpose of assisting her relation <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Boniface in his
conversion of the Germans, and in establishing the angelic
life among the women of this country.</p>

<p>Crediton in Devonshire had the honor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Boniface’s
birth about the year 680, and Exeter has to boast of his
education under the pious Abbat Wolphard. At about
twenty-six years of age he undertook the conversion of Germany,
but was driven back by the war of Charles Martel.
He was, soon after his return, elected Abbat of Nutcell,
a place subsequently destroyed by the Danes, and never
restored; he left this high situation, however, and, fortified
by the Pope’s blessing and encouragement, he went a second
time into Germany, where he succeeded to so great a degree
as to found the Archbishopric of Mentz; to receive
a plenitude of power with the gift of a pall from Rome,
so as to establish Bishoprics at his discretion; and with an
alteration of his name, which from an unfortunate association
in the English language, seems to us very contrary
to what was intended. The original name of the
primate, the apostle of Germany, was Winfrid, but that
<!--131.png--><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
sounding neither sufficiently soft nor harmonious in Teutonic
ears, Boniface was substituted in its place.</p>

<p>The saint is distinguished by an invention perfectly singular
within the period of authentic history; he enriched
the alphabet with an additional letter, the (w) double u.</p>

<p>Having ascended to the pinnacle of terrestrial glory, he
at last obtained the crown of martyrdom through the
medium of an ignorant mob excited by the priests, whose
craft he had destroyed.</p>

<p>Little is recorded of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Walburga except the general
piety of her life and the miracles performed by various
minute subdivisions of her relics, which sufficiently attested
her beatitude. There is a church dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Walburga
at Bristol.</p>

<p>The great tithes of this parish are in the Eliot family.
The vicarage is in the gift of the Crown, being annexed to
Treneglos.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, that the chief manor in this parish,
called Fentrigan or Ventrigan, belonged to the Priory of

THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons states, that the manor of Warleggon, carrying
with it the advowson of the rectory, has been long in
the Gregor family. Another manor of the same name, belonging
to the Corytons, was purchased by John Trengove,
otherwise &mdash;&mdash; Nance, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> in the year 1680, from whom
it has descended to James Wyard Gooch, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Orford
in Suffolk.</p>

<p>The manor of Carborro or Carburrow has been for a
considerable time in the family of Arscott Bickford, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
of Deansland in Devonshire.</p>

<p>The church and tower of this parish suffered most
severely from lightning so recently as in the year 1818,
when on Saturday the 14th of March, according to the
accounts then published, the tower was almost shivered to
pieces, and a part falling on the church, nearly destroyed
the whole interior, as well as the roof.</p>

<p>The improvidence and carelessness of mankind, in respect
to contingent dangers, more especially when they are unconnected
with individual interest, is not in any instance
more manifestly displayed than in what regards precautions
against the tremendous effects of lightning. Tower after
tower has been struck in the county of Cornwall, and
scarcely one is provided with a simple metallic rod, which
would obviate all danger; and, more astonishingly still,
vessels of war, with hundreds of persons on board, and
merchant vessels, laden with the richest cargoes, are allowed
to proceed on voyages, exposed to the danger of utter destruction
from this cause, on account of a reluctance to incur
an expense almost imperceptible in the general outfit, if
no value were placed on human life. On this subject the
reader may be desired to consult the writings of William
Snow Harris, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> <abbr title="Fellow of the Royal Society">F.R.S.</abbr> of Plymouth, one among the
distinguished natural philosophers of modern times.</p>

<p>Week <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary is situate in the hundred of Stratton,

south North Pendyrwyn, east Tamerton.</p>

<p>In the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester

Magdalen’s church at Lanceston), this being dedicated to
the Blessed Virgin Mary, as its tutelar guardian.</p>

<p>This Wike <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary was the birth-place of that famous
minion of fortune and example of charitable benevolence
Thomasine Bonaventure. Whether so called from her
success in worldly affairs, or from her ancestors, is altogether
unknown to me; most certain it is she was born of
poor parents about the year 1450, tempore Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> but
not so poor but that her father had a small flock of sheep
that depastured on the wastrell of Wike <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary downs
or moor, whereof she was the shepherdess, (see Carew,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 282, Lord Dunstanville’s edition,) who on a certain day
in that place doing this office, it happened that there passed
by a London mercer or draper that traded in this country,
who was going to visit his customers in those parts, and
gather up such monies as there were due from them to him
for such wares as he sold. This gentleman, at first sight,
observing the beauty of Thomasine, desired to talk with
her, and, after some discourse, found her discreet answers
suitable to the beauty of her face, much beyond her rank
and degree. Then inquiring into her circumstances, as to
her riches, and understanding that she was poor, and she
likewise inquiring into his wealth, and where he lived,
which was as aforesaid; whereupon he told her, if she
would go to London and reside with him as a servant, he
doubted not but it would be very conducive to her wealth
and preferment.</p>

<p>Thomasine replied, that she was under the guardianship
of her father and mother, and that she could not accept
his proposal without their consent; but if they were made
acquainted therewith, and approved thereof, and he appeared
to them to be such a person as he pretended, she
knew nothing to the contrary but that she might embrace
his offer.</p>

<p>Whereupon this Londoner forthwith applied himself
to her parents, and gave verbal assurances, that if they
would permit their daughter Thomasine to go to London,
<!--137.png--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
and become a servant to him, she should not only have
good wages and be well used, but in case he happened to
die while she was with him, he would so effectually provide
for her that she should not have occasion to try the friendship
of any other person afterwards; and to strengthen
those his proposals, he produced some of his acquaintance
and debtors in those parts, who satisfied her parents as to his
reputation and integrity for performance of what he promised.</p>

<p>Upon which report Thomasine’s parents consented to
his request, so that soon after she was conveyed or carried
up to London, and entered as a servant in this gentleman’s
house, when she demeaned herself very well, to the good
liking of himself and family; when it so happened that in
a few years after, this tradesman’s wife sickened of a mortal
distemper and died, and some time after Thomasine and her
master were solemnly married together as husband and wife,
who then, according to his promise, endowed her with a
considerable jointure in case of her survivorship; and about
two years after, having no issue, he died; and by his last
will and testament further made her his sole executrix,
leaving her a rich widow whom he took a poor servant.</p>

<p>This dower, together with her youth and beauty, procured
her to the cognizance of divers well deserving men,
who thereupon made addresses of marriage to her, but
none of them obtained her affection but only Henry Gall,
an eminent and wealthy Citizen of London, to whom, after
he had made another augmentation of jointure in case of
her survivorship, she was accordingly married, and lived
in great amity and reputation with him as a wife for some
years, till in fine this Mr. Gall sickened of a mortal distemper
whereof he died, and left Thomasine a richer widow
than he found her, aged about thirty years.</p>

<p>After which the fame, virtue, wealth, and beauty of the
said Thomasine spread itself over the City of London, so
that persons of the greatest magnitude for wealth and
dignity there courted her; and amongst the rest it was the
<!--138.png--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
fortune of John Percivall, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> to prevail with her to become
his wife; after which it happened that he was chosen
Carver at the table of the feast of Sir John Collet, Knt. Lord
Mayor of London, the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1487,
at which time, according to the custom of that City, Sir
John drank to him in a silver cup of wine, in order to make
him Sheriff thereof for the year ensuing (in conjunction
with Hugh Clopton, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>); whereupon he covered his
head, and sat down at the table with the Lord Mayor of
London, and was accordingly one of the Sheriffs thereof.
Afterwards, in 14 <abbr title="Henry Seven">Hen. VII.</abbr> 1499, the said John Percivall,
was elected Lord Mayor of London, and knighted by that
King, at which time Thomas Bradberry and Stephen Jenings
were Sheriffs thereof.</p>

<p>By this gentleman our Thomasine had a third augmentation
of jointure and wealth, together with the title of
Dame or Lady, which she lived many years to enjoy after
the death of Sir John Percivall, Knight. After which,
Dame Thomasine, having no child by either of her three
husbands, spent the remainder of her days, till about the
year 1530, when she died, in works of piety and charity;
as repairing highways, building bridges, endowing or providing
funds for poor maids, relieving prisoners, feeding and
apparelling poor people, with her treasure and riches; and
especially in this parish of Wike <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, where she was
born, she founded a chantry and free school to pray for
her soul, the souls of her father and mother, her husbands
and relatives. To this chantry and school she added a
small library, with a fair house for lodgings for the schoolmaster,
and chanters or singing men, and others, parts of
which are yet extant; and endowed the same with £20 lands
for ever. In which place, during the latter part of the
reign of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> many gentlemen’s sons, both in
Cornwall and Devon, had their education in the liberal
arts and sciences, under one Cholwell, a good linguist, as
Mr. Carew saith.</p>

<p>But, alas! afterwards, in the Parliament of the fourth of
<!--139.png--><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
November, first of King Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> 1550, all colleges,
free chapels, chantries, fraternities, and guilds, throughout
this kingdom, being dissolved and given to that King, this
chantry and free school underwent with others the common
downfall, and its revenues vested in the Crown, from
whence it passed to &mdash;&mdash;, now in possession
thereof.</p>

<p>There are two fairs kept yearly in this parish on the 8th
of September and the 10th of December.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church is situated on an eminence, and is therefore
conspicuous at a considerable distance in all directions; it
is large, and built in the usual manner of western churches
with three aisles of equal height; but the tower is so lofty
as to exceed in height (according to report) any other in
the county, even those at Probus and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn.</p>

<p>The church town is large; and the inhabitants preserve
a shadow of former traditionary importance by electing an
annual mayor, who used at least to receive some voluntary
obediences from his townspeople in the settling of
small differences between them.</p>

<p>The etymology of the prefix Week seems to be less obscure
than most other additions to proper names. Week
is in Cornish literally, sweet, an epithet frequently applied
to female Saints.</p>

<p>The church town is in all ancient records called the

<p>The ancient manor of Week <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary appears to have
been merged in that of Swannacot, which belonged to the

<p>The manor of East Orchard Mauvais was purchased
from Mr. Dennis Rolle by the late Sir John Call.</p>

<p>There is a place near the church town called Castle

<p>The advowson of the rectory belongs to Sidney-Sussex

in exchange for another immediately connected with his

About the year 1663, the tower and bells of this parish
church were struck down with thunder and lightning, and
broken to pieces in a stormy night, and a great part of the
roof of the church broken in.</p>

<p class="p2">And in particular those lands to the Lord Botreaux, by
whose heir it passed in marriage to Hungerford, from Hungerford
to Hastings, from Hastings to Edgecomb, from
Edgcomb to Parkinge, from Parkinge to Vivian of Truan,

<p class="p2">Lan-cor-la, in this parish, was formerly parcel of the
manor of Ryalton, the Prior of Bodman’s lands, who endowed
this church upon part of the said manor’s lands,
with a considerable glebe, at least eighty statute acres of
ground.</p>

<p>This little barton of Lancorla was anciently the voke
lands of a considerable manor, now all dismembered, held,

by the Records of the Exchequer and Carew’s Survey of
Cornwall, page 46, by the tenure of knight’s service.</p>

<p>It is now by lease in the possession and dwelling of the
writer hereof, from Sir Jonathan Trelawny, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> Sir John
Seyntaubyn, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> and Sir George Cary, of Clovelly,
knight, as heirs to Jenkin of Trekeninge, to whom it came
by purchase from Botreauxes and Parkinge’s heirs and
assigns.</p>

<p>This manor of old contained fifteen Cornish acres of
land, before dismembered tempore Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> that is to say,
638 statute acres, and was privileged with the jurisdiction
of a Court Baron or Leet, and had a steward or bailiff
pertaining thereto as dependant on Ryalton aforesaid.</p>

<p>Checkenock, now Killignock (S. T.) in this parish, was
another district taxed in the Domesday Book 1087, from
whence was denominated an old family of gentlemen surnamed
de Killignock, where they flourished in good fame
for many generations, till the time of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> when
the only daughter and heir of Thomas Killignock was
married to Richard Nanskevall, alias Typpet, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb,
which marriage brought these lands into his possession,
where for three or four descents his posterity flourished in
genteel degree, till the latter end of the reign of King
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> when Matthew Typpet, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married
Ringwood, of Braddock, having encumbered his estate with
much debts, sold this place and the manor of Borlace
Varth to Mr. Joseph Hawkey, his attorney-at-law, to pay
costs in defence of actions brought against him by his creditors;
and his other lands to Bligh, Vivian, and Hals, the
writer of these lines, and left his son and heir a beggar.

<p>Tre-with-an, in this parish, i. e. the Tree Town, or
Town of Trees, tempore Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> was the land of Stephen

by the tenure of knight service, 25 Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> £20 per

Parkings is now in possession thereof. The arms of Parkings

<p>In this parish stands Damelsa Castle, a treble entrenchment
of earth on a high mounted bank or hill, on the
south side of, and contiguous with, Damelsa House and
lands. Probably it was erected before the Norman Conquest,
to resist the incursions of the Danes, since those
three rampiers consist of rude stones and earth after the
British manner, as a hedge, not a wall. (See Castle an
Dinas, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb). For after the Conquest aforesaid,
castles in England were generally built of lime and stones
after the manner of the French. Probably it was demolished
tempore King Stephen or King Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> when,
many hundreds of those castles by their decree were pulled
down in this island, as our chronologers all tell us.</p>

[N. B. This is a singular, perhaps a single, instance of a
Norman or Saxon family assuming a Cornish name. Indeed
I suspect it not to be true; and what is more certain,
that species of apples which in Cornwall we call a Borlase,
and more commonly a Treluddera, pippin, appears plainly
to have taken its name from this family and that place, and
serves as a good opening for explaining all those other names
of apples which are merely Cornish in themselves like this.

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>It seems that Great Skewish, in this parish, belonged to a
family of that name, one of whom was an author at a
period so early as the reign of Henry the Sixth, when he
compiled an abridgment of the Chronicles and the Wars
of Troy; but in all probability the work has never been
printed, since it is not noticed by Warton; nor is the
author’s name to be found in the catalogues of our public
libraries.</p>

<p>But the glory of this parish is Michael Tregury, Archbishop
of Dublin.</p>

<p>Six or seven years ago, my attention having been drawn
to this individual, who may justly be considered an honour to
Cornwall, I applied to the Very Reverend J. R. Dawson,
Dean of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick’s, through his brother the Right Honourable
George Robert Dawson, when the Dean most
kindly and liberally supplied me with a drawing of Archbishop
Tregury’s tomb, as it is restored by the celebrated
Doctor Swift, and furnished me with all the particulars
known of my distinguished countryman.</p>

<p>I procured a wood engraving to be made of the drawing,
and sent it, with whatever I could collect of Tregury,
to the Gentleman’s Magazine, a reprint of which will here
be inserted:</p>

<p class="blockquote">You will much gratify me, and, I may venture to add,
many other correspondents, by inserting in your most excellent
repository, which has now survived one century with
a spirit and vigour that give promise for its continuing
through another, some particulars of an individual sprung
from this county, who must have been a man of talent and
of learning sufficient for adding lustre to any origin; but who
is now almost entirely forgotten, his family having long
since become extinct, and the records of the University,
of the Church, of the Diocese, and of the Province over
which he presided, having in great measure perished in the
devastations of the civil war, and especially of those aggravated
by religious dissensions.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Lysons, in his History of Cornwall, states, that in
the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wenn is situated Tregury, Tregurra, or
Tregurtha, the seat of a family so called, of whom was
Michael de Tregury, Archbishop of Dublin, who died in
1471. The last heir male of the elder branch of this family
died in the reign of Henry the Fifth, leaving three daughters
coheirs, who sold this barton to the family of Botreaux,
from whom it passed successively, by inheritance or sale,
through the families of Hungerford, Hastings, Edgcumbe,
Parkins, and Vivian, to Mr. William Hals, who wrote the
Parochial History of Cornwall, and resided here in the
latter part of his life. The estate, now called Tregotha, is
the property of Thomas Rawlings, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p class="blockquote">This brief notice of the Archbishop scarcely made any
impression on my mind beyond a mere recollection of the
circumstance, when a Cornish gentleman informed me that
he had observed a monument to this Prelate in the Cathedral
at Dublin. I then took the liberty of applying,
through Mr. Dawson, Member for the County of Londonderry,
to his brother the Dean of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick’s, who not
only gave me every information and reference that is known
to exist, but also a drawing of the monument, of which I
have sent a wood engraving.&mdash;Since this was engraved, I
<!--148.png--><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
have seen a tracing from an old drawing in the possession
of Sir William Betham, Ulster King at Arms, which
shows that the sides of the original altar-tomb were adorned
with trefoil-headed arches rising from short pillars.</p>

<p class="blockquote">It appears that few records are extant of the Prelates
and Dignitaries of Dublin prior to the Reformation, in
places where they might most reasonably have been expected
to be found; and the monument itself would have
perished but for the care and attention of the celebrated
Doctor Jonathan Swift, who, with the Chapter, exactly a
hundred years ago, rescued it from a dilapidated chapel,
and carried the monument to its present situation in the
Cathedral.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Michael Tregury attained his reputation for learning at
the University of Oxford. He was Junior Proctor in the
year 1434, under which Anthony Wood gives the following
notice of him in his “Fasti.” He “was now Fellow of
Exeter College, and about these times Principal of several
Halls successively that stood near to the said College. But
the King, having a special respect for him (being now accounted
the utmost ornament of the University), made him
Prefect or Governor of [the College at] Caen in Normandy,
lately erected by King Henry the Fifth of England;
which office he performing with singular applause,
became at length, through divers preferments (of which the
Deanery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael of Pencryche<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span> was one) Archbishop
of Dublin in Ireland.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">The foundation of the College or University of Caen, is
again mentioned by Wood in his Annals, under 1417. In
consequence, he says, of discontents regarding preferment
and tithes, “the corruptness of provisions, and especially the
wars between England and France, many dispersed themselves
to other places. And because Normandy, Angiers, Poyctou,
<!--149.png--><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
Aquitaine, Bretagne, Gascoigne, and other places that
were subject to the Crown of England, could not for that
reason exercise their Scholastical Arts at Paris publicly
and without murmurings, they receded to Caen in Normandy,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
and studied there, which place Henry the Fifth,
of England, made an University, causing one Michael Tregorie,
an Oxford Doctor, sometime Fellow of Exeter College,
to be governor and reader there, to the end that the
doctrine of the University of Oxford might dilate itself and
take root in those parts.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">The following memoir is extracted from Ware’s History
of Ireland, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 359:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Before the close of the same year (1449), Michael Tregury,
a native of Cornwall, and Doctor of Divinity of the
University of Oxford, was consecrated Archbishop of this
See. He was a man of such great eminence for learning
and wisdom, that in the year 1418, King Henry the Fifth
invited him over to Caen in Normandy, to take upon him
the government of a College, which that Monarch had
then founded in the said city; to whom he joined, out of
the Mendicant Friars, learned professors in all sciences.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span>
There he is said to have discharged the trust committed to
him with great applause, both by his public prelections and
writings. A catalogue of his works may be seen in Bale
and Pits. At last, upon the death of Talbot in 1449, he
was promoted to this See by a papal provision, and was the
same year, on the 10th of February (English style), restored
to the temporalities by King Henry the Sixth, whose
Chaplain he was: [But was obliged to submit himself to
the King’s favour, and renounce every clause in his Bull
prejudicial to the Crown.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span>] He was called into the Privy
Council immediately, and had twenty pounds per annum<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span>
<!--150.png--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
granted him by the King, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro sano consilio</i>, for giving good
counsel, as his predecessors, Archbishops of Dublin, who
were of the Council, had; and in 1453 King Henry the
Sixth, for securing an arrear of two years and a half, and
the growing salary, granted him a custodium on the manor
of Tassagard, and the town of Ballachise, parcel thereof,
to continue during the time he should be Archbishop of
Dublin.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“In certain Annals ascribed to Dudley Firbisse, there
is a mention made under the year 1453, that an Archbishop
of Dublin was taken prisoner at sea. I must leave the passage
to the credit of the Annalist, not having met any hint
of it elsewhere. There is extant in the Black Book of the
Archbishop of Dublin (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 82), a copy of a Bull of Pope
Pius the Second, dated the <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> of November 1462, and
directed to the Bishop and Archdeaconry of Ossory, commanding
them to pronounce excommunicated, Geofrey
Harold, Thomas and Edmund his sons, Patrick Birne,
Thady Sheriff, Thomas Becagh, Robert Burnell, and other
laymen of the city and diocese of Dublin, for laying violent
hands on this Prelate, and committing him to prison; and
that they should keep them under excommunication until
they went to Rome for absolution, with the testimonials of
the Bishop and Archdeacon. The reason of this insult is
no where mentioned, that I can find. He repaired the
manor house of Tawlaght, and died there in a very advanced
age, on the 21st of December 1471; having
governed this See about twenty-two years. His remains
were conveyed to Dublin, attended by the clergy and citizens,
and buried in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick’s Church, near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s
altar [as he had directed by his will], where heretofore
might have been seen a specious monument, adorned
<!--151.png--><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
with his statue, of elegant workmanship, on which are inscribed
the following verses, penned without the aid of the
Muses:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i2">‘Præsul Metropolis Michael hic Dubliniensis</div>
  <div class="i2">Marmore tumbatus, pro me Christum flagitetis.’</div>
</div>

<p class="blockquote">And at the head of the statue,</p>

<p class="center">‘Jesus est Salvator meus.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“This monument was found under the rubbish in St
Stephen’s Chapel; the cover of it was preserved by the
care of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Jonathan Swift, Dean of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick’s,
and the Chapter, who in the year 1730 fixed it up in the
wall, on the left hand, as you enter the west gate, between
the said gate and the place where heretofore the Consistory
Court was held; and they have placed this inscription over
it: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Vetus hoc Monumentum, è ruderibus Capellæ Divi
Stephani nuper instauratæ erutum, Decanus et Capitulum
hùc transferri curaverunt, A.D. 1730.’</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“The will of this Prelate, dated the 10th of December
1471, is extant among the manuscripts in the Library of
Trinity College, Dublin (B. 52), whereby he deviseth his
two silver gilded saltsellers (salsaria) with their covers, to
make cups for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick’s, to serve in divine offices. He
also bequeathed his pair of organs to the said Church, to
be used at the celebration of divine service in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s
Chapel. ‘I devise also (says he) that William Wyse,
whose industry for this purpose I choose, shall in my stead
visit with a decent oblation <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount in Cornwall,
which by vow I am bound to perform either by myself
or proxy;’ and also orders him to give some largesses towards
building the neighbouring churches near where his
friends dwell.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The registry<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span> of the Dominican Abbey in Dublin
gives an account, that above fifty persons went out of the
<!--152.png--><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
Diocese to Rome in 1451, to celebrate the jubilee then
held under Pope Nicholas the fifth, and that this prelate
gave them recommendatory certificates to the Pope; that
seven of the number were pressed to death in the crowd,
besides what died in their return. This squares with the
relation given by Mathias Palmerius, in his additions to
the Chronicle of Eusebius, ‘That there was so great
a concourse of people from all parts of the Christian world
at this jubilee, that at Hadrian’s Mole almost two hundred
perished in the press, besides many who were drowned in
the Tiber.’ They who returned sate in 1453, brought the
melancholy news, that Constantinople was taken by the
Turks, and the Emperor Constantine Palæologus slain.
Our Archbishop was so afflicted at the account, that he
ordered a fast to be kept strictly throughout his diocese for
three days together, and granted indulgences of an hundred
years to the observers of it; and he himself went before
the clergy in procession to Christ Church cloathed in
sackcloth and ashes.”</p>

Edmund Hele, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> his son, Sheriff of Cornwall, 22 Charles
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr> whose son dying without issue, those lands and much
other descended to his daughter Lucy, the wife of John
Basset, of Tehidy, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> now in possession thereof. The
name Hele, Heale, is Saxon English, and signifies the
same as hell in British, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> a hall, either of a dwelling house
or refectory, or a place of judicature or prætorium, a
tabernacle or a tent.</p>

<p>The arms of Heale are Gules, a bend lozengy Ermine.</p>

<p>The name of the parish is derived from a white rock, on
which part of the church is founded. It is a large white

stone in the south side of the church; the part which
appears is of an oval form. This account I had from Mr.
Nicholas Hoskins, <abbr title="junior">jun.</abbr> and vicar of Boyton, son to the
rector of this.</p>

<p>In anno 1291, 20 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> this church was valued (<abbr title="Taxio Beneficiorum">Tax.

<p class="p2 center small">THE MANOR OF WHITESTONE.</p>

<p>This, in Domesday Book, is called Witestan, being one
of the manors given by William the Conqueror to Robert
Earl of Morton, when he created Earl of Cornwall the

<p>In the extent of Cornish acres, 12 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> (<abbr title="Carew folio">Car. f.</abbr> 48),
this, by the name of Wilston and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petnell (<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petronel,

<p>The 3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> (Idem, <abbr title="folio">f.</abbr> 40 b.) John de Cobbeham
held one fee in Wiston and Serpeknol, which I take to be
the same with the former, only wrong spelt.</p>

<p>[The name of the parish is not derived, I apprehend,
from any white stone on which the church is founded.
From the very description here given of it, it could never
have given name to the church itself. Only “part of the
church is founded” on it. Nor is this part “founded” on
it. There is only “a large white stone in the south side
of the church;” and this is plainly built up in the side, as
it is said to be “of an oval form.” The reference of the
name to this stone, therefore, has been merely the idle play
of intellect, in those who in antiquarian matters did not
know how to exert their understandimg seriously. The
real name of the church is “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petnell, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petronel, I
suppose.” The church then could not give name to the
parish. And the parish actually received its name from
the manor, as the manor received it from its manerial

house, this being built upon a white rock, that very rock
assuredly from which the white stone in the wall of the
church had been brought. W.]</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The church and tower of this parish, like several others
in the north-eastern part of Cornwall, are fine objects in
themselves, and are placed on commanding situations.</p>

<p>There are several monuments to former residents and
proprietors in the parish. Among these is one to the
memory of George Hele, of Bennetts, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who died in
1652, and of his son Warwick Hele, who died in 1650.
The family of Hele had resided for many generations at
Bennetts, which came into the Basset family in the latter
part of that century, by the marriage of John Basset, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
of Tehidy, with Lucy Hele. Their great-grandson, the
late Lord Dunstanville, was in the habit of visiting Bennetts
for several weeks at a time. This place had been
leased for lives to a respectable family of the name of
Webbe, probably soon after it came to Mr. John Basset.</p>

<p>The advowson of the living belonged to the Arundells of
Lanherne and Wardour, who sold it about fifty years ago;
and, after passing through various hands, it came to the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Kingdon, who is also the incumbent, instituted
in 1793. The net value of the living in 1831 was £231.</p>

This Nectan was born in Devon about the year
940, a man of singular piety and holiness, as most of those
days afforded, who lived a monkish or eremitical life, at
Hartland, in Devon, where he died about the year 1010.
After his death his relics (see Rawlegh’s Relicta Nomen
viri) were enshrined and set up in the same little chapel
where he served God there; in which place Githa, wife
of Godwin Earl of Kent (or rather Goditha his daughter,
afterwards married to Edward the Confessor), as Malmesbury
informs us, 1030, built and endowed a monastery of
secular priests, which might marry wives; valued at the
suppression, 26 <abbr title="Henry Eight">Hen. VIII.</abbr> at £350 per annum; and the
reason of this her pious foundation is said to be, for that
<!--160.png--><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
she was fully persuaded that her husband, Earl Godwin,
escaped the danger of a shipwreck in a raging tempest at
sea by his merits and intercessions.</p>

<p>Galfrid de Dynham, Lord of Hartland, was a great
benefactor to this monastery, and changed the Secular
Priests into Black Canons Augustine, who were prohibited
marriage by their rule. See the Monasticon Anglicanum,

THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow is beautifully situated on
the eastern bank of the river, at its most beautiful part,
between Lestwithiel and Fowey. The church, with its
tower, are fine objects as seen from the river, which does
not yield in this spot to the Dart itself. The Church contains
several monuments.</p>

<p>The vicarage house and glebe partake of the splendour
of the scenery; and during the life of their late proprietor, the
Reverend Robert Walker, were among the most attractive
spots in Cornwall. Mr. Walker, possessed of strong abilities,
had an ardent desire to discharge all the duties attached to
him as a clergyman and as a country gentleman, in a manner
the most beneficial to all with whom he had any concern;
in the relations of private life he was equally estimable;
and as a most decisive proof of his real merits and
high deserts, it may be truly said, that, although he was
induced on principle to take a strong part in politics, he
had not a single personal enemy.</p>

<p>The chapel, dedicated to the Recluse of Hertland, has
still divine service occasionally performed in it, although it
does not form any practical division of the parish.</p>

<p>The history of Ethy has been brought down to the period
immediately preceding its possession by the Edgecumbe
family; the house has been occupied of late years by several
gentlemen, and especially by one who has done honour
to the nation by his naval and military services, and to
Cornwall as a private man. Admiral Sir Charles Vinicombe
Penrose distinguished himself on so many occasions,
that to enumerate them all would be to write a life. Two,
which do not relate immediately to the more obvious features
of the military profession, may, however, be selected.</p>

<p>In the year 1797, when the navy of England underwent
the greatest disgrace it has ever experienced, by the prevalence
of a mutiny which threatened our safety as a country,

France from the Pyrenees, and his passage was disputed
across the Adour, Admiral Penrose, uniting to scientific

constructed a bridge of boats where it was thought
impossible to place them, and thus greatly contributed to
the success of this important part of the combined attack.</p>

<p>Withiel is situate in the hundred of Pider, and hath upon
the north <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock, east Lannyvet, south Roach, west <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Wenn. As for those names, they are synonymous in
Cornish, and signify in that phrase, a place of trees, which
heretofore it was; and is so called, for that this church is
situate upon the manor of Withell Goose, i. e. Tree Wood,
or a place heretofore consisting in its voke lands of a wood
of trees (neither is it altogether destitute of wood and trees
to this day, though within the memory of man, much of
them have been cut down for buildings and charcoal there,
and all the parish over).</p>

<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest, this district was
rated in the Domesday Book by the name of Ber-neves
(still the voke lands of a manor in this parish, of which,
see more under), as also Trenant or Trenance. In the
inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester into
the value of Cornish Benefices, Ecclesia de Withell, in
decanatu de Pider, was rated at £4. In Wolsey’s Inquisition,
1621, £10. The patronage was formerly in the Prior
of Bodman, who endowed it out of his manor of Withell
Goos aforesaid; which lands and patronage, when that
Priory was dissolved, fell to the Crown, from whence it
passed to Glanvill of Killivor; from Glanvill to Vivian of
Truan; from Vivian of Truan, by marriage of his daughter,
to Vivian of Trelowarren, now in possession thereof; the

<p>Tre-nance in this parish, i. e. the valley town, or
town in the valley, was also rated in the Domesday Book
1087, as then the voke lands of a manor, which place gave
name and original to an old family of gentlemen surnamed
de Trenance, one of which family married Littleton’s heir,
and afterwards removed to Lanhydrock, whereof they were
lords, tempore James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> when Littleton Trenance, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
sold that barton to the Lord Robartes, as a younger branch
of this family, living at Black Haye in this parish, sold Trenance
to Mapowder; and Mapowder sold it to Bone;
Bone gave it to Harris of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s; and Harris sold it
to Hawkins, now in possession of part thereof. The other
moiety of this little barton of Trenance, is in possession
of the Arundells of Lanherne.</p>

<p>John Trenance of Black Haye, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> had issue by &mdash;&mdash;

<p>The arms of Trenance, out of a supposed allusion to
their name, after the Latin, is taken as a corruption of Tre-ensis,
i. e. three swords; whereas, Trenance is the name of
a local place, and signifies as aforesaid, and Try-clothes,
Try-glodes, is three swords.</p>

to Peter Bevill, a younger branch of Gwarnack house;
whose son, Sir William Bevill, dying without issue male,
his brother, Philip Bevill, became his heir; who had
issue only one daughter named Elizabeth, which was married
to Sir Bernard Grenville of Stowe, knight, in whose
issue by her, the name, blood, and estate of this Bevill is
terminated. The which Sir Bernard, and his lady big
with child, for health and diversion residing at Bryn aforesaid,
the said lady happened to fall into childbirth, and there
was well delivered of her first-born son, who afterwards was
baptised at the font by the name of Bevill; which afterwards
proved to be that famous and renowned though
unfortunate hero, Sir Bevill Grenville, knight, slain at
Lansdowne in Somerset, on the part and behalf of King
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> against the parliament army.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Zennar is situated in the hundred of Penwith, and hath
upon the north the Irish sea, north-east Tywidneck, south
Maddarne. For the name, if it be compounded of Sen-nar,
it signifies Holy Pool or Lake; otherwise, if it be a corruption
of Se-nar or Seynar, English Cornish, it signifies the
sea lake, or creek of the sea; and the church is situated in
a valley near the sea, with a rivulet of water flowing by it.</p>

<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest, this district was
taxed under the jurisdiction of Trenwith, or of Alvorton.
When the first inquisition into the value of Cornish Benefices
was made, this church was not endowed, if extant;
however, in Wolsey’s Inquisition (1521), it was rated by
the name of Zennor or Sennor £5. 5<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> The patronage in
the Bishop of Exeter. This parish was rated to the four
shillings in the pound Land Tax in 1696, for one year, at
£86. 10<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span></p>

<p>This church, I take it, was endowed by the Prior of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael’s Mount, and was formerly wholly impropriate.
This parish is comparatively scattered all over with stones
and rocks of great bigness; yet amongst those are found
very many fertile plots of ground for corn, grass, and barley,
as also many tin lodes, tending to the great profit of
the farmers and tinners thereof.</p>

Chapel Jane, that is the narrow chapel.</p>

THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>This parish is beautifully situated, mainly consisting of a
belt nearly a mile wide, between the sea on one hand,
bounded by high and rocky cliffs, and on the other hand by
a chain of granite mountains.</p>

<p>The belt of land, including the church town, is very
fertile, particularly abounding in milk and honey, which we
early learn to consider as proofs of the most abundant soil.</p>

<p>The church and tower are neat and plain, and it is probable
that Mr. Hals’s conjecture respecting its ancient
dependence on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, may be correct, since
one or more of the bells are said to bear an inscription
declaring them the gift of the prior of the Mount.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin says, that the name is taken from a patron
Saint, but no such saint can be found; and the parish feast
is kept on the nearest Sunday to the 6th of May, when the
festival is observed by the Church of Rome, in commemoration
of the virtual martyrdom and miraculous preservation
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Evangelist; when, by the order of Domitian,
he was cast into a caldron of boiling oil before the
Latin or Lateran Gate of Rome, where the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John Lateran has since been built, the chief sacred edifice
in Rome previously to the construction of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s, and
celebrated for the assemblage of various general councils of
the Catholic Church, thence denominated Councils of Lateran.
It is probable, therefore, that this parish may be
under the protection of the divine and beloved Apostle.</p>

<p>Towards the western extremity of the parish a bold promontory
stretches out into the sea, called Trereen Dinas,
but in recent times, from some fanciful resemblance, the
Gurnet’s Head. This is by much the finest and most
romantic point on the north side of the Land’s End, and
it would rival the promontory nearly opposite to it on the
south, called by the same name, Trereen Dinas, or Castle
Trereen, if that were not composed of granite and crowned
by the Logging Rock; while in Zennar the sea shore and
<!--170.png--><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
the cliffs are every where green stone, surrounding the
granite.</p>

<p>For a description of this headland, see the Second
Volume of the Transactions of the Royal Geological
Society of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 200. The Editor was so much
struck with the appearance of this bold formation, that he
purchased the manor of Treen and Baswedneck chiefly for
the purpose of acquiring the property of a mass of rocks so
geologically interesting.</p>

<p>The impropriation of the great tithes belongs to George
John, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Rosemorron, and of Penzance.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The greater part of this parish is situated on granite,
which presents the varieties common to the Land’s End
district. The northern part, in the form of an irregular
band, consists of schistose rocks, with the exception of a
small patch a little to the north of the church, and another
which extends from Polmear Cove to the western boundary
of the parish. These slates are for the most part felspathic,
and, at their points of junction with the granite, exhibit
some beautiful illustrations of granitic veins in the slate.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Note, that Penzance, by a mistake, is not numbered

GENERAL REMARKS ADDED HERE BY MR. WHITAKER.</p>

<p>It is stated by Carew:</p>

<p><abbr title="Folio">Fol.</abbr> 8. “They [the Cornish Tinners] maintaine
these workes [“two kind of Tynne workes, <em>Stream</em> and
<em>Load</em>”] to have beene verie auncient, and first wrought by
the Jewes with <em>Pick-axes</em> of holme, boxe, and <em>hartshorne</em>:
they prove this by the name of those places yet enduring,
to wit <dfn>Attall Sarazin</dfn>, in English, the <dfn>Jewes’ Offcast</dfn>, and
by <em>those tooles daily</em> found amongst the <em>rubble of such
workes</em>.” So, in the stream-work now prosecuted at Carne
between Truro and Penrin, were found two stems of deer-horns,
which I inspected at Tregothnan in <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 1792, and
which had been plainly shaped into pickaxes. One of them
was even tinged strongly at the picking end, with the stain
of some metallic matter on which it has been employed.</p>

<p>Not far from them was found a brass instrument, that
had clearly, from the shade still remaining upon the
covered part, once had a handle clipping it round the
middle, and leaving out the two ends for striking. July 19,
1794, was promised by Lady Falmouth a sketch of all
three, done by the hand of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Hennah, Rector
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austle; but, as he had pronounced the brass instrument
to be no celt, and as I proved it to be one, he never
sent the sketch.</p>

<p>“There are also taken up in such works,” adds Carew,
“certaine little tooles’ heads of brasse, which some terme
thunder axes; but they make small show of any profitable
use. Neither were the Romaines ignorant of this trade,
as may appeare by a brasse coyne of <span class="sc">Domitian’s</span>, found
in one of these workes,” stream or load, “and fallen into
my hands.”</p>

<p><abbr title="Folio">Fol.</abbr> 56. “Most of the inhabitants can [speak] no word
of Cornish, but <em>very few</em> are ignorant of the English; and
yet <em>some so affect their owne</em>, as to <em>a stranger they will not
speake it</em>: for, if meeting them by chance, you inquire the
way or any such matter, your answer shal be, <em>Meea navidua
cowzasawsneck</em>, I can speake no Saxonage.” W.]</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">THE ISLANDS OF SCILLY.</h3>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Hals nor Mr. Tonkin has noticed these
islands.</p>

<p>It may be proper, therefore, to add a few observations on
their ancient history, of which however very little is known.</p>

<p>That the Phœnicians, and after them the merchants of
Carthage, traded with the Britons for tin, is established
without the slightest doubt; but no possible absurdity can
be greater than the supposition that voyagers, having sailed
through the Mediterranean Sea, and passed between the
Pillars of Hercules into the exterior ocean, and navigated
through this boundless and dreaded expanse of water for
about a thousand miles, should then stop short at trifling
islands, or rather rocks, and that too year after year during
centuries, with the country before them, actually in sight,
from whence the valuable commodity which they sought
must have been manifestly taken, and where they would have
been sure of an improved market for the commercial articles
to be given in exchange. Yet, relying on the literal interpretation
of passages from ancient authors, who never
visited the land of tin, nor possibly ever conversed with the
adventurous sailors who had been there, persons of account
have gravely asserted that the rocks of Scilly were the ancient
Cassiterides; while others, to render this strange supposition
somewhat less absurd, have glossed it with the
miracle, probably invented by Florence of Worcester, of a
large tract of country between these existing islands and
the Land’s End, having been engulphed within times of recent
memory.</p>

<p>Perhaps this mode of induction, directly opposed to common
sense and to experience, may be a remnant of the
hallucination which bound itself round men’s minds at the
<!--173.png--><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
period when the stores of ancient learning were first
poured on modern Europe; under this delusion they were
not contented with ascribing a high degree of merit to the
artists, to the writers, to the architects of Greece and
Rome; nothing short of absolute perfection was believed to
exist in each, and this servile appeal to authority is not
even yet quite obsolete, although the time for such delusions
being in the slightest degree advantageous either to
literature or to science, has long since passed by.</p>

<p>The traders who frequented these remote shores would
naturally mistake land in the great unbounded ocean for
mere islands, and their vague descriptions, purposely made
obscure, proved so successful that Julius Cæsar was not
aware when he landed on the coast of Kent that he was
arrived in the country producing tin.</p>

<p>The rocks of Scilly, having inhabitants, were visited by
monks and anchorites, who formed establishments there,
and gradually associated themselves into a small priory;
but, so early as the time of King Henry the First, their
monastery, with all its appendages, was given to the Abbey
of Tavistock. The grant is extant.</p>

<p>There is also a letter of protection from King Edward
the First for the prior of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas, within his island de
Scilly. This letter is addressed among others, to the constable
of his camp in the island of Enmour in Scilly.</p>

<p>Enmour may well be a corruption of Ennis Moor, the
great island, possibly the secular name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s.</p>

<p>In the time of Edward the Third, this priory or cell to
Tavistock must have been of very little importance, since in
the 19th year of his reign, it appears by the following entry
in the Abbreviatio Rotulorum Originalium, that two
monks only were resident. Since, for some reason which
it is difficult to discover, secular priests were to be stationed
in Scilly during the continuance of a war with
France, instead of the monks, which gave rise to the following
agreement:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Abbas et Conventus de Tavistok finem fecerunt cum
Rege per viginti solidos, pro licentia habenda, quod ipsi
duos capellanos sæculares pro animabus progenitorum Regis,
quondam Regum Angliæ, et hæredum suorum, in
Insula de Sulley celebraturos, loco duorum Capellanorum
commonachorum suorum, quos ibidem ex causa prædicta
invenire solebant, durante guerra inter Regem et homines
de Francia mota, invenire possint.”</p>

<p>Since the Reformation the tithes have been appropriated,
and passed with the different leases of the lands. Remains
of the convent, most properly dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas,
are still to be seen on the island of Trescow. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas
was the patron of mariners, and frequently preserved
vessels in a miraculous manner when his aid had been fervently
invoked; perhaps the right of wreck was given to
the convent for the pupose of attaching an increased degree
<!--176.png--><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span>
of merit to their prayers in favour of ships likely to
be dashed against those rocks.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas had also delegated to him from Heaven the
peculiar care of infants, as a reward for his early piety,
which induced him, in the first month, to abstain from
taking the nourishment afforded by his mother’s breast on
Wednesdays and Fridays, and on all occasional fasts
appointed by the church.</p>

<p>He was Archbishop of Myra, a city of Lycia, in Lesser
Asia, where he died in 342; but in 1087 his relics were
forcibly taken from thence, and conveyed to the town of
Bavi in Italy, towards the opening of the Adriatic, and
where they continue to perform the most wonderful cures,
more especially in all cases of infants.</p>

<p>The Scilly Islands first became objects of public attention
in the great civil war, and especially towards the latter
part of these struggles. After the death of King Charles
the First, Sir John Grenville, subsequently created Earl of
Bath in memory of the battle at Lansdown, where his
father fell in the arms of victory, having collected a small
force, kept possession of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s island, where they
either constructed or enlarged lines, rather than a fortress,
which still remain. Their opponents encamped themselves
on Trescow, till at last, as relief was clearly impossible,
the cavaliers surrendered, but not till they had
evinced their honour and true feelings as gentlemen, by
refusing to accept any terms from a foreign power, and
preserving the integrity of England, although it was in the
hands of their deadly foes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for these islands, they remain public
property, or as it is termed, belong to the Crown; and a system
has prevailed, at least from the time of Queen Elizabeth,
one of the very worst that could be devised, of granting
them at an annual rent, and for a short term of years, to
private gentlemen; renewed, indeed, in the same line for
more than two hundred years, first to the family of Godolphin,
<!--177.png--><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
and then to the family of Osborne, which succeeded
to the property of the former, but always with an uncertain
tenure and the impossibility of encouraging others to expend
capital on any permanent undertaking.</p>

<p>A better system has, however, been at last adopted,
although very inferior to the plain, simple, and natural one
of making the land freeholds in the hands of individuals.</p>

<p>Either the former lessee for years no longer wished to
retain a source of small patronage, rendered of little importance
by well-known changes, or the government resolved
on doing something beneficial for the inhabitants and
for the country; at all events, a lease for lives has now been
granted to Mr. Smith, a gentleman of ability and information,
the eldest son of a respectable country gentleman,
under certain conditions, and among them a stipulation for
essentially improving the harbour by the construction of a
pier, the government contributing a certain sum towards
the expense, and the lessee undertaking to complete the
work. Mr. Smith, it is understood, means to reside there;
and great expectations are entertained of the benefit likely
to result.</p>

<p>Such a cluster of rocks, from eight to nine leagues west-south-west
off the main land, must always be dangerous to
ships returning from distant voyages; but the risk has
been very greatly diminished by the excellent light on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Agnes. There is, however, one rock called the Wolf,
somewhat more than a third of the distance of Scilly from
the Land’s End, on which a light-house might be erected;
and the losses of lives and of property on this rock, which
lies immediately in the way of all coasting vessels, more
especially of those from Ireland, are supposed by many
competent judges to exceed the losses occasioned by all the
other western rocks taken together.</p>

<p>Before lights were placed on the coast, and the soundings
laid down with accuracy, and the nature of the ground
described, and before astronomical observations were
<!--178.png--><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
brought to practical perfection, the wrecks were, perhaps,
quadruple to what they are at present, and with not one
fourth of the vessels at sea: among the innumerable wrecks
that have taken place at Scilly, the most remarkable is that
of the Victory, a first-rate ship of war, commanded by Sir
Cloudesley Shovel, returning from a series of exploits, which
continued adding to his reputation even when they failed of
obtaining success. This ship, with two others of a smaller
size, struck on the rocks of Scilly in the night following the
<abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> of October 1705, when between fifteen hundred and two
thousand men are supposed to have perished; and there is
a tradition of one man having escaped, and of his relating
some anecdotes of obstinacy, and even of violence, on the
part of the Admiral, discreditable to him as a man, and
the immediate causes of the calamity; but these additions
induce me entirely to disbelieve the whole tale.</p>

<p>The Scilly Islands are composed of granite, similar to
that of the Land’s End district, and intersected by small
lodes of tin, but not of a size sufficiently large to have produced
at any period a quantity worthy of mercantile account.</p>

<p>The land does not rise into lofty hills, nor are the rocks
on a scale of magnificence; and the people have been so
much absorbed in trade and in intercourse with strangers
from all nations, that they are without any legendary histories
or peculiarity of manners.</p>

<p>Although <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s, Trescow, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes’, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Martin’s, Bryher, and Sampson, have alone permanent
inhabitants, yet a great many more islands are dignified
with specific names. Among these one rock is honoured with
the appellation of Scilly; and this trifling circumstance
has given rise to theories about changes and devastations
by the sea, by earthquakes, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> when the name has clearly
been given in the same spirit as that which induced seamen
to declare that the cord attached to the water bucket
is the only rope belonging to a ship.</p>

<p><!--179.png--><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
Alterations in the laws respecting Customs and Excise,
with increased vigilance as well as greater activity, both at
sea and on shore, have materially interfered with the most
lucrative trade of these islanders. They are, however, tolerably
well supported by their agriculture, which is said to
afford more corn than they consume; by their fisheries,
particularly of ling, which are exported after being pressed
and dried almost without salt; and finally, by the resort of
ships in great numbers when the wind happens to be in
opposition to their intended voyages.</p>

<p>Doctor Borlase has written a separate treatise on the
Scilly Islands, and described in it the scanty remains of
their supposed Druidical antiquities.</p>

<p>At the time of the last census (in 1831) the population

<p>A recent benefit has been given to Scilly by the legislature,
in respect to their police and to the administration of
justice. The sole authority previously existing in the
islands resided in a court possessing very limited power,
and that undefined, so that no case of any magnitude could
be acted on in any other way than by sending the parties
over to the main land; an Act of Parliament has now enabled
<!--180.png--><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
the executive government to appoint magistrates who may
act in Scilly, without qualification by the possession of freehold

APPENDIX.<br /><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2">The Editor has been favoured with the following list of
plants illustrative of the mild climate of Cornwall.</p>

<p class="p2">The native plant of greatest curiosity is the Erica Vagans,
Erica Didima of Withering, Erica Multiflora of Ray
and Hudson. This plant spreads over the whole serpentine
formation of the Lizard, and observes its limits almost
to a foot. It is said to appear again at Clickitor near
Liskeard, where the serpentine formation is also found.</p>

<p>The Ligusticum Cornubiense, remarkable only from its
extreme rarity, grows near Bodmin, in a place called Margaret’s
Wood.</p>

<p>The Tamarix Gallica grows in great abundance about
the Lizard, apparently wild, but it is said to have been
brought there from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount in the early part
of the last century; and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount having been
long a cell to Mount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael in Normandy, the
shrub may very probably have been introduced by the
monks. It powerfully resists the sea winds, and grows
freely on the banks of earth or sand surrounding inclosures
near the shore. The wood is so solid as to sink in
water.</p>

<p>The Panicum Dactylon grows on the bank of gravel
lying between the sea, and the road leading from Marazion
to Penzance.</p>

<p>The Sibthorpia Europæa may be found in great plenty
about half a mile inland from thence, in a stream flowing
westward by the road near Gulval church town. This
plant was named by Linnæus in honour of Humphry
<!--187.png--><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
Sibthorpe, M.D. Professor of Botany at Oxford from 1747
to 1784. The hybrid variety or monstrosity of the Antirrhinum
Linaria, called Peloria, is said to grow at the foot
of Mabe Hill on the old road leading from Helston to
Penryn. The Erica Ciliaris has recently been found at
Carclew, near Penryn, the seat of Sir Charles Lemon,
M.P. for the county.</p>

<p>And many of the cryptogamia flourish in a degree unknown
in other countries, among which the magnificent
Osmunda Regalis may be selected as a specimen.</p>

APPENDIX.<br /><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2">Since the parish of Broadoak was printed, an additional
sheet of Mr. Hals’s manuscript has been communicated
to the Editor by his friend the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Richard Polwhele.
It contains an account of the important military events
which distinguished that parish and the neighbourhood, in
1644, and it is therefore printed as a curious addition to
what has here been given in the body of the work, on the
same subject. Mr. Polwhele has also sent another sheet
relative to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s near Saltash, but that does not
contain anything of the least importance.</p>

<p>These two sheets appear to have been separated from
the work at Exeter by the carelessness of the bookseller
in whose hands the whole had been lodged, and this confirms
the suspicion of more important losses having taken
place at the same time.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p class="p2 center small">BROADOAK.</p>

<p>Broadoak is situate in the hundred of West, and hath
upon the south Boconnock, west <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow, east <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pynock,
north Cardinham; and by the name of Bradock it
was taxed in Domesday Roll, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087; which
word, if it be single, signifies a rebel or traitor, one that
betrays the trust and fidelity reposed in him by another;
<!--191.png--><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
otherwise if it be commonly understood of Brad-ock or
Brodock, it signifies broad trees of oak (Saxon).</p>

<p>In the Pope’s Inquisition into the value of Benefices
before-mentioned, 1294, Capella de Bradock in decanatu
de Westwellshire, appropriata Domui de Lanceston, was
valued at xiii<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> iv<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> from whence it appears the church
was endowed by the college of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s or Lanceston;
in Wolsey’s Inquisition or Valor Beneficiorum at
£8. 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>; the patronage in the Bishop of Exon, the
incumbent Pearce, the rectory in possession of &mdash;&mdash;;
and this parish was rated to the 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per pound Land Tax
for one year, 1696, £57.</p>

<p>Here let it be remembered that Robert Devereux, Earl
of Essex, General of the Parliament Army, being in Devon,
received orders from his masters, 1644, to march
from thence with the same towards Plymouth, in order to
raise the siege thereof, it being then greatly distressed by
Sir Richard Grenville, as was the west part of that county,
who immediately set forward with his army, and marched
on towards that place; yet not so quickly but that Grenville
had notice of his motion, and, fearing he was not
strong enough to engage his great army, he by night privately
dislodged from the siege of Plymouth with his own
regiment, Colonel Fortescue’s, Colonel Carew’s, and Colonel
Acland’s; and the better to shun or avoid his enemy,
marching down by way of Plympton, he turned aside towards
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Botolph’s and Saltash Passage, where with boats he
passed over his troops, and so entered over the Tamar
river into Cornwall; which Essex understanding as soon
as he came to Plymouth, having thus raised the siege and
relieved the town, forthwith marched after Grenville as far
as Lestwithell and Bradoak Downs, himself quartering at
Lanhydrock, the Lord Robartes’s house, and sending out
troops of horse westwards if possible to attack him. In
the mean time, King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> being then in Somerset
with his army, and having notice of those facts of Essex’s,
forthwith marched out of Somerset through Devon with
his army for Grenville’s relief, and entered Cornwall by
way of Polston bridge, the 11th of August 1644; from
thence advanced to Lanceston, and so directly to Liskeard,
which place for some time he made his head quarters,
where the townsmen and contiguous countrymen
shewed themselves very zealous and loyal towards his service,
especially for that the town or borough and manor of
<!--192.png--><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
Leskeard was his son the Duke of Cornwall’s lands, in
right of his Duchy of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Soon after which the country people gave private notice
to the King, that on a certain day the quarter-master,
General Dalbier, Lieutenant-Colonel Charleton, Colonel
Allured, Colonel Barkley, and some other officers of Essex’s
army were to dine at the Lord Mohun’s house, not
far from Lestwithell.</p>

<p>At the day appointed the King dispatched a party of
horse, and by surprise took them all prisoners (except
Dalbier, who made his escape) and brought them all prisoners
to Leskeard, where soon after Prince Rupert
arrived at the King’s army, which gave great hopes of a
notable victory over Essex; and, in order to give him battle,
the King soon after drew forth his army from Leskeard,
and marched west to Bradock Downs in this parish,
opposite to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow and Boconnock Downs, where
Essex lay encamped, on the east side of Lestwithell town,
and there pitched his camp and standard, he himself,
Prince Rupert, and Grenville quartering at the Lord Mohun’s
house; from whence he sent a letter August 16th,
as he had sent another before from Leskeard by the Lord
Beauchamp’s nephew, to Essex, for a treaty of peace, to
which he received no answer; then he sent another letter
to him in the name of the officers of his army, to which
Essex sent a negative answer directed to the Earl of
Forth, purporting that he had received a letter from his
lordship, and other commanders of the King’s army, by
which a treaty with him was desired for a general peace,
which he could not admit of without a breach of the trust
reposed in him by the Parliament, having no power by
his commission to treat in a matter of such importance.</p>

<p>Whereupon happened several skirmishes between the
cavaliers and parliament troops; and in particular that
challenge and sharp charge between Colonel Straughan’s
for the Parliament and Colonel Digby’s for the King, was
most remarkable. Straughan’s troop consisted of a hundred
young men from sixteen to twenty years of age, on
whose faces, as was said, never razor had past in order to
shave their beards, all double, if not treble armed for this
encounter. This troop of Straughan’s was led forth by
himself on Bradock and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow Downs, having nothing
on his head but a hat, and on the trunk of his body
nought but a white linen shift, where they braved it for
<!--193.png--><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>
some time as was said before, giving defiance to a like
number of the King’s party in sight of the King and
both armies; whereupon soon after dislodged the Lord
Digby’s troop for the King, to accept and fight this challenge
of Straughan’s, who with great resolution and bravery
advanced towards him, and gave the first onset or
charge, but firing their pistols at too great distance, it did
little harm to his adversary, whilst instantly Straughan,
like a firebrand of hell, with a led horse by his side, had before
commanded his boys, as he called them, to take their
adversary’s fire, which they then did with unspeakable
hardiness, and rushed on to the very horse heads of
Digby’s troopers, that before had spent their shot, himself
leading the fore front to the very points of their
swords, when he discharged his double-barrelled pistols,
and was in like manner seconded by his troopers, who had
all the same sort of pistols, and most of them laden with
three or four bullets each, which proved so fatal and disastrous
a blow to Digby’s troopers, that the one half of
them were slain on the spot or mortally wounded; and it
was further observable, that scarce horse or man that
escaped went not off without some hurt or damage, as I
was told by one Mr. William Maye, a gentleman that was
one of Digby’s troop, and sorely wounded in this battle, the
marks of which through his hands, arms, and legs were
visible, though cured to a large degree, till his dying day,
1672; and much the like account I had of this battle or
combat from Mr. William Upcott, of Truro, and Mr. Joseph
Upcott, of Morval, brothers, that were parcel of
Straughan’s troop, who there took some of the King’s
horses alive, their riders being slain, upon whose furniture
was his proper arms, the star and the letters C. R.</p>

<p>But, alas! notwithstanding this success of Straughan’s
troop, the King with his army had so hemmed in or surrounded
Essex in his head quarters at Lestwithell, that he
could not long subsist or have relief for his soldiers, for the
Lord Goring and Sir Thomas Basset, Knt. stopped all
provision with a great body of horse, that was coming to
him by way of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey from the west, as Sir Richard
Grenville did the like by way of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb, Bodmin, and
Lanhydrock from the north; whereupon it was resolved
by Essex’s council, that he should desert his army, and
privately by night in a boat go down the river to Fowey,
and from thence take ship for Plymouth, which expedient
<!--194.png--><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
was accordingly put in execution, and the General Essex,
the Lord Robartes, and some others the next day got into
Plymouth, being the 31st of August 1644. On the same
day Sir William Balfour with two thousand five hundred
of the Parliament horse, with divers officers, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Colonel
Nicholas Boscawen, his Lieutenant-Colonel James Hals,
of Merther, Henry Courtenay, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bennet’s in Lanyvet,
Colonel John Seyntaubyn, of Clowans, and his Lieutenant
Colonel Braddon, Colonel Carter, and several other officers
and gentlemen of quality, early in the morning forced
their passage over <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow, Boconnock, and Bradock
Downs, though the body of the King’s army, which lay
encamped on the heath in those places, maugre all opposition
to the contrary; from thence they rode to Leskeard,
from thence to Saltash Passage, and from thence to Plymouth
safely the same day, amidst their own garrison and
confederates.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this desertion of the general and other
officers as aforesaid, Major General Skippon (a Londoner),
like a good commander, resolved to live and die with his
soldiers; and in order to their preservation, being at least
twelve thousand men, he led them down the banks of the
river on the west side thereof towards Foye, in order to
transport them over the passage or river to Lanteglos, or
ship them from thence for Plymouth, all other roads and
high ways being stopped up by the King’s army as aforesaid,
during which march Skippon’s men were sorely distressed
in the rear by the King’s soldiers, so that five of
their field pieces were taken in the lanes, whereupon the
next morning his men made a stand, and with a brigade of
horse that never deserted the infantry, charged the King’s
troops with great courage and animosity, and beat them
out of the field which they had lost the day before, with
some loss; whereupon immediately the King sent Captain
Brett with the Queen’s troop to attack them, who in the
King’s sight charged Skippon’s brigade with that fury and
violence as forced them to retire from the field aforesaid,
whereby not only he regained the ground that was lost,
but got some other fields from his party, and then returned
in good order, having lost only four men, himself
being shot in the arm, for which brave adventure the
King knighted him on the spot. After which the Parliament
soldiers were so dispirited that they could hardly be
<!--195.png--><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
brought to stand to their arms; upon which dismay Colonel
Butler and a trumpeter came to desire a parley with the
King, which was forthwith granted, and a treaty followed
on the first of September, when the Commissioners on the
King’s part were Prince Maurice and the Earl of Bramford,
for Essex’s soldiers Major-General Philip Skippon,
Colonel Christopher Whichcott, and others, by whom
a cessation of hostility was agreed upon in these terms &mdash;</p>

APPENDIX.<br /><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></h3>

<p class="hanging"><span class="decoration">Observations on an Ancient Manuscript, entitled Passio
Christi, written in the Cornish Language, and now preserved
in the Bodleian Library; with an account of the
Language, Manners, and Customs of the People of
Cornwall. By William Scawen, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Vice-Warden of
the Stannaries.</span> (<cite>From a Manuscript in the Library of
Thomas Astle, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> 1777.</cite>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="decoration">On the Manuscript itself. On the description of the Passion
contained therein. On the tongue in which the
Passion is described, and the properties thereof, and how
it relates to and concerns the people and places of Cornwall.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Concerning</span> the manuscript itself, (which is the ground
of the fabric) the first thing that presents itself is the outside,
which is not polished, but in a homely, humble
simplicity, and written upon a rough old vellum, which
may be supposed to be before parchments here came
much into use; and by the rude pictures set out therewith,
it may seem to be before the art of painting became
better amongst us.</p>

<p>Next to behold the chirography thereof, written in no
other than the old Court Hand, not of the best form, but
seeming somewhat older than we find it in other places,
and some of the letters and characters different from the
common Court Hand.</p>

<p>As to the speech itself, it is such as the common
speakers of the Cornish now used here do not understand,
nor any but such as will be at the pains to study it, no
<!--197.png--><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
more than the common speakers of the vulgar nation of
the Greeks do at this day Homer’s Iliad. So the Lord’s
Prayer in the year 700 was thus in English: Vren fader
thic arth, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In 900, Thu ure fader the eart on heofenum.</p>

<p>As to the antiquity thereof, we observe the name of our
Saviour is all along written IHS, after the old form used
in crucifixes, and then also the name written Chrest, not
Christ. So we find it written in Tacitus, Suetonius, and
in some other Roman authors it may be found. So
Christians were called Chrestians, as Tertullian observes,
<abbr title="Apologeticus, chapter">Apol. c.</abbr> 3.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span> And so the vulgar in Cornish speak it Chrest,
and not Christ.</p>

<p>In this old piece are no words antiently intermixed of
the Saxon tongue or Angles, which shews, in all probability,
that it was written before their time at least, if not
much further off; whereas, the common speech of it now
carries much of those latter figures, to the disfiguring of
the face thereof. But of all other intermixion, it seems
to receive in it (with a kind of delight) the tongue of the
Romans, by whom the people were easily brought to take
up that tongue which they brought with them, and afterwards
more and more by degrees in succeeding times,
the Roman speech was interwoven with the Cornish, out
of a natural propensity to it, as that tongue came to be
used of all other nations afterwards, as was observed
before.</p>

<p>Another argument there is (and that which is to be
admired and rejoiced at) that in this old piece of the Passion,
there is nothing heretical, little of error to be found,
or savouring of ill opinions; which is strange, since it has
passed through so many ages, in which so many ill broods
have been hatched, and, amongst others, one of our own,
the Pelagian heresy, a brat bred here amongst us at Bangor.
Nor is there any mention made of any monastical
persons, or several orders of men so living. Nothing
that refers to Monks, Friars, Priors, or to any other
orders, secular or sacred, nor any thing said in approbation
or dislike of any such thing.</p>

<p>There is nothing in it savouring of the old bards or
their poetry, nor having references to Merlyanisms, but
a bare and sober relation of matter of fact.</p>

<p><!--198.png--><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> As to the description of the Passion and Resurrection
of our Saviour, I cannot again but admire, that it is
so unpolluted with the Arian or Pelagian heresies. There
are, it is true, some inoffensive and harmless traditions,
and a word may be let slip of the Virgin Mary; and in
those traditions you may observe the concurrence of others.</p>

<p>And, first, concerning this Longis: it is to be inquired
whether he be not that Longinus mentioned in our
Calendar on the fifteenth of March, or that Longinus on
the first of December; for of Longinus there is the same
history to be found in Picinellus his Mundus Symbolicus;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span>
whose words are, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. P. Comestor ad Longinum vitiosos et
caligantes fuisse oculos, cum vero fluentem in Christi
latere sanguinem casu illis admovisset, videndi acumen
recepisse. In eandem Septentiam canit S. G. Nazian-zenus.</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i0">Ubi fixit hastam, defluentis sanguinis</div>
  <div class="i0">Tinctam liquore, et ecce! ut utraque manu</div>
  <div class="i0">Hausit, oculosque hoc ungit hinc ut scilicet</div>
  <div class="i0">Detergat oculum nocte, que cera legit, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></div>
</div>
<div class="p2 poem">
  <div class="i0">When into Christ he thrust his tainted spear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lo! unto both his hands the blood flow’d there,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wherewith he anoints his eyes and then saw clear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which like the night till that time blinded were.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Lassells, in his Voyages into Italy, tells us, that
the picture of Longinus stands under the top of the spear
with which Christ’s side was pierced, in the cupola at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Peter’s church at Rome. It may be conjectured, that this
tradition owes its origin to the literal sense of that prophecy;
“they should look on him whom they had pierced.”</p>

<p>For the wood of the cross, (another of the traditions,)
Genebrard’s account thereof, as reported by Purchas in
his Pilgrimage, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 30, comes somewhat near it, which is,
that Seth went to the Cherub which kept Paradise, and
received three grains of the Tree of Life, whereof we read
in the Apocalypse, “The leaves shall heal the nation.” With
these three grains was an oil made, wherewith Adam was
anointed, and the stones put into his mouth, whence sprang
the tree whereof the cross of our Lord was made, hidden
<!--199.png--><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
by Solomon in the Temple, and after in the pool of
Bethesda; according to which, in a church window at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Neot’s, is one pictured putting something under another’s
tongue, with this inscription, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hic Seth ponit tria grana
sub lingua Adæ</span>. If any list to see further about the
timber whereof the cross was made, let him read Mr,
Evelyn’s Sylva, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 3, <abbr title="Number">Num.</abbr> 17. As to that of the smith’s
wife, in forming the nails for the crucifixion, perhaps they
might think, that as the first woman had the first hand in
the transgression, so a woman must be employed in the
last act of this tragedy. We may observe,</p>

<p>1. What true and manifest notions these antient people
had, and faithfully retained, of the Trinity, and the reverence
they gave them.</p>

<p>2. How distinctly and clearly they did set forth, in
those dark days they lived in, the several distinct attributes
of the Deity, assigning power to the Father, wisdom
to the Son, goodness to the blessed Spirit.</p>

<p>4. How well they agree and adhere to the doctrine of the
true church of Christ, in the points maintained by us concerning
the loss and fall of man and mankind, and the
restoration of him, and concerning the eternal decree and
purpose of God, in the salvation of man, notwithstanding
his fall.</p>

<p>We may observe by the Resurrection, thus shortly
declared as it is, that it appears plainly that those people
were not Nullyfidians.</p>

<p>Nor were they Solyfidians.</p>

<p>They placed the foundation of their happiness in belief.</p>

<p>And the superstruction thereupon in good works.</p>

<p>Lastly, we cannot think they were any way inclinable
to the minds of those scoffers at the day of judgment,
which <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter meets with in his second Epistle, 2, 9,
and 10. Our people acknowledged, that at the Great Day
of account a punishment shall be upon the wicked, and a
glory expected to be given to the godly. Thus far as a
taste only of what is contained therein.</p>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> On the tongue in which the Passion of our Saviour
is thus described, we have, among other things, such as
these observables:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. The Idiom.</li>
<li>2. The Innocency and Cleanness.</li>
<li><!--200.png--><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
3. The Wisdom.</li>
<li>4. Significances of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>1. For the Idioms. They put the substantive before
the adjunct or adjective. 2. The preposition sometimes
comes after the noun. 3. It is usual to change a letter in
the beginning, middle, or end of a word or syllable, and
sometimes to omit in each for sound sake. 4. They contract
several words into one for sound sake, and that very
short also; with many other changes, of which it is hard
to know or find any certain rule now, but some may be
made out upon reading, due observation and experience
had on this that follows; and for the pronunciation, the
Cornish is not to be gutturally pronounced as the Welsh
for the most part is, nor mutteringly as the Armorick, nor
whiningly as the Irish (which two latter qualities seem to
have been contracted from their servitudes), but must be
lively and manly spoken, like other primitive tongues.</p>

<p>2. For the Innocency of it. What is most remarkable is,
that it hath a most excellent defective qualification in it,
peculiar to itself; for, whereas all other tongues abound
in execrable oaths, the old Cornish have none at all, not
so much as reproachful terms. The word that comes
nearest to an oath with them is Areire, Areiaree, which is
Mary, Mary, spoken by way of wonder. The next good
defective qualification is, that there are no great titles in
it, which Nutricule Tyrannidis.</p>

<p>3. For the Wisdom, Proverbs (which contain usually the wisdom
of a nation) they have had, but we cannot find them in any great
plenty. Yet some there are worthy observing, as these:</p>

<ul>
<li lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Cows nebas, cows da, nebas an yeveren an gevella.</li>
<li>Speak little, speak well, little of public matter is best.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Cows nebas, cows da, hada veth cowsas arta.</li>
<li>Speak little, speak well, and well will be spoken again.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Taw Tavas.</li>
<li>Be silent tongue.&mdash;To call one Tavas Tavas, Tongue
Tongue, is as great a reproach as you can put upon any one.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Reys yw meeras dueth ken lemmell uneth.</li>
<li>Look twice before you leap once.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Neb na gare y gwayn coll restewa.</li>
<li>He that loves not gain loss befall him.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Neb na gare y gy an gwra deveeder.</li>
<li>He that loves not his dog will make him a choaked sheep.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li lang="kw" xml:lang="kw"><!--201.png--><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
Non ges goon heb lagas na kei hebs scovern.</li>
<li>There is no down without eye, nor hedge without ears.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Na reys gara anvor goth ragan vor noweth.</li>
<li>Do not leave the way old for the way new.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Guel gw gwetha vel goofen.</li>
<li>Better keep than ask.&mdash;This is spoken of a wariness
and precaution concerning lending.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Grova da rag, tha hannen te yn gurd.</li>
<li>Do good, for thyself thou dost it.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Significancy of the Tongue. Adam gave names to
the creatures, according to their natures; but the people
of this land, having no better guide, have given names
upon long experience had, and much observation made of
the nature of things, and those do mostly appear now as
to places and families. I shall adventure upon some
instances:</p>

<p>Lanceston, alias Dunhevet. Camden would fain have
it to be Fanum Stephani; indeed <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, which is
a mile off, seems to be the mother church, Lanceston
the daughter church. Others would have it to be Lancelot’s
Town, one of the Champion Knights of King Arthur,
but that is further from truth. The Chief Justice Foster,
talking with me about it, would fain have Dunhevet to be
the most ancient name, from Dune a town, and Hevet
above it, which there is accordingly. I told his lordship
we must fetch the derivation higher, from the Cornish
original (and not from the Saxon), and that is Leostofen,
which is a place of large extent, or a broad end, which is
properly so according to the situation thereof, at the broad
end of the county, from whence it grows towards the west
still narrower, like to the point of a wedge. I read in a
good author, that Radulphus, brother to Alfius, Duke of
Cornwall, was founder of Lanceston. I think he means
the castle there, not the town.</p>

<p>The names of places above, and from those places downwards,
have suffered much violence along the river from
Devon side, by reason of the mutations formerly spoken
of; but from thence we shall take notice of some that have
received their names antiently, passing down the river of
Tamar (and on some of the branches thereof) where, by the
way, I may say I am astonished at some of our late Geographers,
who, in enumerating the famous bridges in all this
have omitted altogether ours in Cornwall, of which, among
<!--202.png--><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
land, other lesser, we have three that are very eminent, one
of which, Wadebridge, stands further west; the two others,
besides many smaller, are on the river of Tamar; one
Horsbridge, the other called Newbridge. But much more
I wonder at their omission among the rivers of the famous
river of Tamar, a river, after the Thames, not behind
any of note in this kingdom, which I mention the sooner,
because it is most properly ours in Cornwall; for though
it be great and very navigable far up, yet it arises in and
floats only in this little county of Cornwall, and its whole
course contains within the same, and it is the boundary
thereof from other parts, wherein other streams do flow,
Linnar, Fiddy, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and before it falls into the Estuarium,
where it gives entertainment from Devon on the other
side to Tavy, Plym, Yeom, and others, where they all
lose their names in Tamar. And I do much more wonder
that it should be printed by some others, that this famous
river should fall into the sea near the Land’s End, whereas
this alone possesses the whole honourable harbour of
Plymouth (more than sixty miles distant from the Land’s
End), and stands appropriated to the interest of Cornwall,
belonging to the Duke thereof, the Prince of Wales. And
to return to what I said last, in coming down from this
broad end of the county to that famous harbour, though
our next bordering neighbour Devonshire and the saints,
have stolen away from us many of the antient British
names, and intruded upon us many strange ones, yet
some left us here and there of the antient speech all along,
upon the river and the branches thereof, which I am
obliged to memorize.</p>

<p>Lawhit, in Glamorganshire, is said to be Fanum Iltuti,
to which the Ton being added in Cornish, makes it up.
Iltutus was an ancient British Monk in King Arthur’s time.
Landue may be the church or chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David, though
Landuan in Cornish is the black church or chapel. And
for Lezant, that is the holy saint, meaning <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, to
whom that church was dedicated.</p>

<p>As Cargreene, which is a rock in the gravel standing in
a green place. Carbeele or Carbilly, a rock mentulæ
formæ. Carkeele of the same signification.</p>

<p>Landulph, where <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dulpho is memorized by the
church’s name, and the well there so called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dulpho’s
well. Halton, i. e. Haelton, a green place near the water.</p>

<p>Pillaton, a round or clue by a green.</p>

<p>Larrake I did formerly suppose to have been from Laun
<!--203.png--><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
or Lun, which is usually set for a church or chapel; but
on better consideration I think otherwise of it now, because
I find several other places hereabouts written Larrake,
which have no reference to church; and because the
manor antiently was written and called Larrake, which is
antienter than the church, and it signifies a place of content
in Cornish.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Blerrake I take to be of the same signification too; a
little from which latter place, if content may be had from
a prospect, it is there in my opinion. A place formerly
called Ballahow, now the fairest and amplest I know any
where, excepting such as are dignified by the sight of a
metropolis, or such places of eminency, though it stands not
on a promontory, and but a little from the sea in a plain,
though but a rough one, and from it you may look directly
into the sea, as far as human eye-sight can enable you.</p>

<p>Towards the sea-shore on the one side, you have in eye
the Start in Devon, and westward the Lizard, for your
boundaries. Towards the land northward, the wild moors
of Devon, called the East Moors, and the other side the
West Moors in Cornwall. Between those you may
observe the vale countries of both, two rich valleys, one in
Devon side, and the other in Cornwall, and take the sight
of Tamar as their boundaries, and you will wonder, looking
at it from above, to know how to think that river should
find a way through those countries to the sea, especially if
you consider that you seldom see water in those tracts of
land by which it passes, yet you see also as it passes
Plymouth the royal citadel, Plymton, Millbrooke, and
abundance of small villages and boroughs in a country on
each side pleasant, and the whole prospect not obscured
by hills, or any thing else by which you may be hindered
from the sun in any part of the day; besides this overlooks
the Eddy-rock or stone, a dreadful place about a league
out in the sea, where many hundred of ships have been
wrecked, being in the trade way to the harbour from the
west; yet I have heard some antient skilful mariners to
<!--204.png--><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">198</span>
aver, that if a good artist should go about to strike on this
rock purposely, he would not be able to do it, so far doth
chance go beyond art.</p>

<p>Cuttenbrake is a concealed head, and E. Trematon, a
place on three hills.</p>

<p>Inesworth, which is Ineswartha, the island above, or
the higher island, in respect to the situation of the island
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas below, where the saint hath gotten the
mastery again.</p>

<p>Ints or Ince, which is a proper name for an island,
though this be joined, as Insworth is, by a short neck to
other parts of the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s. Here passing,
we come by the mouth of the river to Pembernose, which
is in Cornish the head of the night, or midnight, as if it
were said that there is safe coming in there at any time;
and from thence we pass to the uttermost point westward,
called Penlee, which is the headland to the leeward; and
so sailing along by the sea side to the two Gayers, the
East and West Gayers near Ramehead, which may give
nomination to families of that name in the west, which
are now worn out there, and have had a good recruit in
Plymouth, and from thence a better in London, by a late
Lord Mayor, there so called, but taking his descent from
Cornish original, according to the word.</p>

<p>Rame is a long ridge of rocks, and here called Ramehead,
because it is so formed towards the sea like a ram’s
horn, which hath turnings in it to put mariners in mind
thereof: in Cornish Pendenhar. Sailing along from thence
by the sea side, we come to Millan Dreth, that is, a mill
on the sea sand at Loo,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span> or Lough, which is a common
name with most nations for a low or watery place, and so
Port-Loo, and Port-pinnion, the little port, nigh to which
also is Denloe, or Delough; and stepping a little from
thence in the land, is Minhinnitt, which is a hill on a
highway, and so indeed it is rightly styled; and the well of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lollo, and the foot of Liskeard. Near to it is Liskeard
(a near neighbour thereto), some say a place
affected; others take it from the Cornish word Leskeveres,
like length, like breadth, a square, so it anciently was, and
so fortified, as the castle walls yet in part remaining show.
Some would not have us go so far back, but would have
<!--205.png--><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
us take it from a physician so named, and a miracle supposed
to be wrought by him there, and this may be right
also; but then we must suppose that to be <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Luke the
physician, and some ground there is for that also, for the
most antient street thereof is to this day called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Luke’s
street. Luke’s Day also is their day of feasting, and for
choice of their Governor. This agrees well enough with
the former as the fortification of it; and towards the sea
again we come to Lestwithiel. Some hold that to be
lion’s tail or lion’s train; others take it to be ‘enough
together.’ The place, though now grown much in decay,
hath formerly been held the only shire town, and where
the Knights of the Shire have been still chosen, and the
Convocation of the Stanneries held, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> A great hall was
lately there, which was used for those purposes in my
knowledge, belonging to the Dukes of Cornwall, who did
the like when under them; and here also they kept their
court and residence, near to which stands yet their castle
Restormell, in Cornish a bellyfull of money, a place of
honey; besides which the Dukes had seven others, Liskeard,
Tintagell, Lanceston, and Trematon, which is in
Cornish three hills on a green top, though that came to
the Crown by attainder. As for the river Vz or Vzell,
which some speak of, I suppose is a mistake; the river
there is the river of Fowey, in Cornish Foath, which hath
its head spring in the moors above it, Venton Foath, in
English called Foycombwell and Aqua de Fowey. As it
comes further down near Foath, is a town or place called
Tywardreth, in Cornish, a town on the sand, or above the
sand, which agrees well with its situation, where heretofore
there stood a priory, the buildings whereof are now
decayed. I may not forget as next to Foath the town of
Polruan, which is now a small village of fishing, but heretofore
famous, standing on the top of an ancient hill,
where are the ruins of a spacious fair church, called yet by
the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Saviour’s, Polruan is in Cornish, a frosty
bottom, or frosty pool, this being seated over against
Foath; between those two towns heretofore there went
athwart the river a chain of iron from a small castle on
each side, for their security against foreigners by sea, but
by their neglect of preserving it in time of peace, was
stolen away from them by some boats that came from
Dartmouth in Devon, and carried there, where the river is
of equal breadth, and the harbour is much like that of
<!--206.png--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
Fowey, and hath over against the town of Dartmouth a
little town called King’s Way, which answers to Polruan
against Fowey. The Fowey men have attempted the restitution
of their chain, but never could obtain it, because they
had been so careless, it being the means of their own
preservation formerly. Between these two neighbouring
towns of Fowey and Polruan, standing one against the
other, in the harbour between them, there used to be
antiently a solemn contention of justing performed upon
the river every May-day, upon two boats singled out of
equal strength, from the one side and from the other, to
encounter each other upon the water, there being a stage
made on each of them, upon the end of the boat,
for the several champions to stand on. Several boats
were to row with six oars a-piece, rowing fiercely against
one another. The champions were arrayed only in white,
slightly but better armed about the breast and neck, and
holding a lance rebated in the form of an oar (according
to their trade); but a fierce attempt they make upon each
other, and one or both of them is usually carried by the
push to sound the depth of the harbour, and then a new
supply of others for fresh encounter is called for again.</p>

<p>This I have seen to be performed in my time, and it
usually drew abundance of people together to behold the
sport from the hills on both sides, and from the town,
with many others, with boats likewise upon the river, and
not without need, to receive up and recover their dejected
champions, who end their encounters in peace, not without
liquor, the element of their contention.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mevagissy, or Mevagissey, a hill to keep mares in.</li>
<li>Penwarn, a head beloved.</li>
<li>Bodrigan, a hill by the ebbing of the sea.</li>
<li>Dudman or Gubman, a place where much ore is cast in.</li>
</ul>

<p>This spot of land called Bodrigan, a spacious fair barton
looking towards the sea, was not very long since possessed
by gentry of the same name, whose estate was great; and
being forfeited to King Henry the Seventh, part thereof
was given to Trevanion, a noble family of this county;
but this Bodrigan, with many other lands, to Edgcombe,
that Sir Richard Edgcombe, of whom let me deliver my
judgment, that he was a witty, valiant, wise, good man,
and a good commonwealth’s man. Witty, as appears by
his hiding himself and throwing his cap and coat away for
his preservation, O quantum est subditis casibus ingenium.
<!--207.png--><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
Valiant, in that he was made a Knight Banneret at Bosworth
field. Wise, in that he was made choice of for one
of the Commissioners for the happy treaty of marriage of
Margaret, the King’s eldest daughter, with James the
Fourth, King of Scots, a happiness to the kingdom at
this day. A good man, and not a pilferer of the people
(as many were in those days); otherwise he would be
named in Perkin Warbeck’s Declaration, set down by
Chancellor Bacon. A good commonwealth’s man, as
appears by that stately and costly fabric of Newbridge
built by him.</p>

<p>Peale, a spire, lies to the north of Tolpenwith a
mile, and it is the true Land’s-end. This spire, called the
Pele, stood on a little island; between it and the shore
there is room for a boat to pass with oars; the spire was
ten fathom or more above the ordinary flux of the sea,
very narrow on the top, hardly room for a man to sit on
it; in the floor it was and is fourteen feet square. In the
year before King Charles the First was beheaded, it was
prodigiously cut off in the floor by a storm, and falling
broke in three pieces.</p>

<p>Herles, truly interpreted Hercules’ Pillars, are a ridge of
rocks a quarter of a mile in length, standing like pillars
divided into small islands, and distant from the Pele a
mile. From these by the north coast we come to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ives, in Cornish Port Eer of Geer, a port with a pool.
Paddestow, so called by Saxon Angles, being Patherickstow.
Another place near by, called Little Petherick,
which partakes not of the Cornish at all; for in the Cornish
it is Lethanneck, a place of much sea-sand, which agrees
well with the site, much sea and much sand there is driven.
A little above which is the house of Edmund Prideaux, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr>
my kinsman, now called Place, formerly Guarandre, or
Warthantre, i. e. above the town or above the sand; but
that we may do right to latter times also, we find much
mention to be made also of Patrickstow, and that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Patrick, after much time spent in Ireland, and endowments
of learning by long study were obtained, he came
into Cornwall, and built a monastery there not far from
the river of Severn, which comes home to that which is
said by Archbishop Usher, as also to the name of the place.

authors it is said, that at Bodmyn his body was buried
but stolen from thence, and carried by one Martinus to
the abbey of Menevy or Mein, in Little Britany; but
upon complaint to the king it was restored, and brought
back undiminished to the Prior of Bodmyn. b. §. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 293.
But whether this were to be understood of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick,
the apostle of Ireland, it is altogether to be doubted, since
as to the burial of his body there hath been so much contention
that that should be at Glastonbury; but another
Patrick there was, perhaps a third, and one of note too,
stiled Sænor Sæenex Patricius, as appears by the learned
primate. He is said to be at the same time, and that he
was Domesticus Sancti Patricii. Another there was also at
some hundred years distance. With one of these it may
better accord than with the great Patricius, who it may be
said, had his name Dignitatis causa, as was usual with the
Romans and Athenians, his parental name being Moun or
Muun.</p>

<p>The town of Stratton, in Cornish Straneton, a green
dispersed with houses. Near this town is the place where
the Cornish forces, on behalf of King Charles the Second,
obtained the glorious victory over the rebellious army,
anno 1643. In memory of which battle Sir Ralph Hopton
was created Baron of Stratton, who afterwards dying
without issue, the same title was conferred upon Sir John
Berkley, both which lords were commanders in the Cornish
army at that time.</p>

<p>There is a pretty vulgar fiction that Tamar, Tamara,
being a subterraneous nymph, was courted and sought
after by Tavy and Tawrage, who found her sitting under
a bush at Morewinstow, the furthest part of Cornwall in
the north. They being weary in searching after her, sat
down by her and slept; she perceiving them to be fallen
asleep, steals away from them suddenly and goes directly
to the south. Tavy being first awakened, goes away
silently after her, not acquainting his co-rival therewith.
Tawrage that awakened last, finding them both gone, in
haste rusheth out, and angrily runs away towards the
north, foaming and fretting all along as he goes, till he
loses himself in the Sabrina; whilst Tavy, on the Devon
side, sends out some of his small streams to visit and
court her, and to observe which way the nymph went, but
she having got the start of him, leaves not of her speed
till she comes into the Sound.</p>

ANTIQUITIES CORNUONTANIC.</p>

<p class="center small"><span class="title">The causes of the Cornish Speech’s Decay.</span></p>

<p>1. The first and great cause of the decay of the Cornish
speech was their want of a character, which not only contributed
to the decay of the tongue, but to the vanquishing
of the nation of the Britons, they being thereby disabled
upon emergent occasions to write or communicate with one
another against their invaders, and so <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“dum pugnabant
singuli vincuntur universi,”</span> as Tacitus says; and he also
observes, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“non aliud adversus validissimas gentes pro
Romanis utilius quàm quod in commune non consulebant.”</span></p>

<p>What would have become of the Roman tongue, when
the Goths and Vandals broke in upon Rome and all Italy,
mixing the Roman tongue with their Runa-Gothica, if
there had not been learned men (amounting to 160 elegant
classical authors in Augustus his time) who preserved the
tongue in their works?</p>

<p>I know it hath been and yet is the judgment of learned
men, that the old Britons never had any character, yet I
hope they will give me the liberty of declaring the reasons
of my dissenting. <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> It hath always been supposed that
Ireland had a character; now Ireland was always accounted
a British Island, however; yet I cannot positively affirm
that the character which the Bishop of Tuam sets forth as
British be really so, there seeming to be little difference
between that and the old Saxon; neither can I consent
to what he saith, that the Saxons, whom he calls their
neighbours, learned their very characters from Ireland.</p>

<p>2. Though we may depend on Cæsar’s<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span> authority, that
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Druidum doctrina non fuit literis mandata, sed memoriæ
fuit, ne aut in vulgus proficiscentur, aut juventus qui eam
perdiscebant negligentia aut in curia remitterent,</span> which
reasons, in my judgment, rather demonstrate that they
had a character to communicate their doctrines by, if they
had pleased to use it. <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> The great use made of the
Roman tongue, the laws of their conquest extending to
letters and speech, as well as to territory; and where there
is a delight, there are things best retained. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romanam</span>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> The great loss of Armorica, near unto us, by friendship,
by cognition, by interest, by correspondence. Cornwall
has received princes from thence, and they from us.
We had heretofore mutual interchanges of private families,
but as to our speech we are alike careless. We can understand
words of one another, but have not the benefit of
conferences with one another in our ancient tongue. I
have met with some Friars born and bred there, who, one
would think, should be able to discourse of their own
pristine tongue, and of their own birthplaces, yet found
them, though not totally ignorant that such things had
been, yet insensible and careless of their former condition.
They could tell me that my name Scawen, was in
their tongue Elders, as here it is; that there are those
that bear the same name, and one of them a bishop; but
when he writ it he changed it to Sambucus, shewing
thereby a mind declared to a new, rather than an inclination
to his old name, and relation to his country speech.</p>

<p><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> But, least the tender lamentations of those losses
should be thought to put us out of memory of the loss of
our tongue, the matter which we have in hand, we are
here to mention a fourth cause, and that which most concerns
this Peninsula of Cornwall, which is the giving over
of the Guirremears,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span> which were used at the great conventions
of the people, at which they had famous interludes
celebrated with great preparations, and not without shews
of devotion<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_33" id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span> in them, solemnized in open and spacious
downs of great capacity, encompassed about with earthen
banks, and in some part stone work of largeness to contain
thousands, the shapes of which remain in many places
at this day, though the use of them long since gone.
<!--211.png--><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
These were frequently used in most parts of the county,
at the conveniency of the people, for their meeting together,
in which they represented, by grave actings, scriptural
histories, personating patriarchs, princes, and other
persons; and with great oratory pronounced their
harangue, framed by art, and composed with heroic stile,
such as have been known to be of old in other nations, as
Gualterius,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span> an ancient father, hath been mentioned to be.
This was a great means to keep in use the tongue with
delight and admiration, and it continued also friendship
and good correspondency in the people. They had recitations
in them poetical and divine, one of which I may
suppose this small relique of antiquity to be, in which the
passion of our Saviour, and his resurrection, is described.
They had also their Carols at several times, especially at
Christmas, which they solemnly sung, and sometimes
used, as I have heard, in their churches after prayers, the
burden of which songs, “Nowell, Nowell, good news, good
news of the Gospel,” by which means they kept the use of
the tongue the better.</p>

<p><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> I cannot find that the British have boasted of many
miracles done among them; if any such antiently there
were, they were deprived of the memory of them by the
Romans. I cannot affirm with so much reason (as some
of our neighbours have done with confidence) who say,
that at the last digging on the Haw for the foundation of
the citadel of Plymouth, the great jaws and teeth therein
found, were those of Gogmagog, who was there said to be
thrown down by Corineus, whom some will have to be
the founder of the Cornish;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span> nor am I able to assert, that
some great instruments of war in brass, and huge limbs
and portraitures of persons long ago, as some say that
have been in some of the western parishes, were parts of
giants, or other great men, who had formerly had their
being there. But we may rather think those to be
imaginary things or devices of old bards said to be there,
though we have no certain memory of them neither. Nor
may we think it strange that such things may be spoken
of, since we may well credit some good historians, that
<!--212.png--><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
write that Alexander, after that he had returned from his
journey to India, caused a great representation to be made
on the ground on the western side of the river Indus, of
a huge campaign almost immeasurable, with tents, cabins,
and platforms, and arms also, for horses, racks, and
mangers, of such height as were not to be reached at; and
that there were also scattered about the ground bits and
bridles for horses, of extraordinary length and bigness,
and that all this “ut de magnis majora loquantur,” and to
make men think upon him and his miraculous acts with
the more admiration.</p>

<p><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> The sixth cause is, the loss of the ancient records,
not of the Duchy or the Earldom of Cornwall, (which
some affirm were burnt, and others lost in the ancient
ruins of the castles of Rostormell, and other such,) but of
those of whole Cornwall, whilst one of the four dynasties
of this island, (or, as Pancirollus,) one of the five.</p>

<p><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> The seventh cause is desuetude, or want of a
continued use; and it is no wonder, if, after so many
losses, the true use of the tongue vanished away or grew
not into contempt. Speeches are compounded of words,
and both of them of one nature, and continued according
to their use, and of one of them it may be said as of the
other</p>

  <div class="i2">May fall to ground for want of use.</div>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> A general stupidity may be observed to be in the
whole county. As to other matters monumental, there is
little mention made of our antient stately fabrics amongst
us, now ruinated; as to the founders of them, castles,
battles fought, and other things: and as to churches
(though we have abundance of fair ones for so small a
county, where there is no city nor any great town in it)
excellent foundations, but who the builders were we have
no intelligence, only a great many false tutelaries of them
we hear of. Little of the monasteries hath been said by
those that have written copiously of others elsewhere.
Scarcely anything of the ancient bishops here, or of the
bishop’s see; only we know it to be said antiently, that it
<!--213.png--><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>
was removed from Bodmyn to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span> and that it
was about anno 1000, Danorum turbine, from a country
more open, to a place more woodland. The cathedral indeed
might have been better memorized by Godwin in
his Catalogue of Bishops, and enumeration of all the
bishopricks; yet little is said of it or the four several
chapels in several distinct places of the parish thereto
belonging; and as for the monastery nothing at all. It is
strange too that Mr. Camden should say, “Germani
viculum nihil aliud est hodie, quam piscatorum casulæ:”
whereas, there are no such things belonging to such a
trade there seen, but instead thereof a cathedral, maintained
at the great cost of the inhabitants, (though a great
part, by an accident, about one hundred years since fell
down,) a good monastical house yet undemolished, and
hospitably inhabited, to the relief of poor people. The
bishop’s seat and house are yet eminently extant in a
Cornish name. The borough of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s enjoys still
the privilege of sending burgesses to Parliament by prescription.
Pity it is that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German, who came hither to
suppress the Pelagian heresy, should have so bad a going
off; for an old fable remains yet in report, that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German
being ill used fled away, leaving a sad curse behind him, to
the cliffs at Rame near the head; where bewailing his
misfortunes, the compassionating rocks in the cliffs shed
tears with him, at a place ever since called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s
Well. True it is, such a spring there is, but the occasion
of it cannot be more truly affirmed than the other part of
the story that follows, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> That he should be carried
thence into remote countries by angels in a fiery chariot,
the tract of whose wheels were said to be seen in those
cliffs, but they are invisible. Thus much for the site of
the place. As to the person of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German, who perhaps
never saw the place, I need not turn over old fabulous
legends, nor a better sort who have written his life heretofore,
but I may have liberty to relate what I have from the
better hands of learned persons.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span> That besides his disputation
and confutation of Pelagius at Verulam, and
thereby freeing the church and nation from those heresies
by a public edict from the Emperor Valentinian, whereby
they were no more troubled with them afterwards, he the
<!--214.png--><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
said <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German did other great works for this land, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
1st. the institution of schools of learning among the Britons;
Dubritius and Iltutus being both of them his disciples.
Dubritius was made Archbishop of Carlehon; Iltutus
sent to Lan Iltut, a church bearing his name to this
day; and one Daniell, made Bishop of Bangor; from
these famous men the monastery of Bangor, and other
monasteries in this land, were so well furnished with
learned men, at the coming in of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin from the
Pope, they stood upon discreet and honourable terms.</p>

<p>2. The introduction of the Gallican Liturgy into use in
the churches of Britany, which was ever different from the
Romans, and thereby a happy means to have kept this
nation from so much acquaintance with the Pope, as they
had with him afterwards, to their great trouble. It is also
said that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick, who carried over into Ireland the
education monastic, and good principles therewith, and is
held to be the Apostle of Ireland, spent many years under
the discipline of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German, when he came hither; who,
after he had been employed in the embassy to the Emperor
at Ravenna, died there one year before the Saxons’
arrival.</p>

<p>All this time we are left in the dark concerning the
fabric of the Monastery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s, which could not
be built till two or three hundred years perhaps after the
Saxons got a perfect dominion here over the land, but we
may believe that that and the cathedral might be dedicated
to his memory afterwards, in respect of the many good
works he had done elsewhere.</p>

<p><abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> As we have had an ill registry of monumental
matters, so for five or six centuries past (before the two
last), I doubt we had but few learned men here, which
induces me to put that to the ninth cause of the decay of
the Cornish tongue. After the suppression of the Druids,
and that Christianity was received, yet learning decayed
some while amongst the people, the best of them being
carried abroad by the Romans and never returned; and
then the supposed Saints coming in after them, made no
reparation thereof, but by their supposed miracles, with
which they entertained the people. So they had very few
learned men amongst them, places of breeding and obtaining
learning being remote, scarcely approachable, and the
nation in continual troubles and dangers; and for latter
times such learned men as came to us, seeing our own
neglect of our tongue, have thought it not fit to take the
<!--215.png--><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
pains to inquire into it, as a thing obscure and not
fit to be studied by them, and so suffered to decay insensibly
by them and the inhabitants.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr> The Cornish tongue hath mostly resided for some
ages past in the names of the people, the gentry chiefly,
and in the names of places, observed to be significant
mostly as to the site, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> or for some things eminent
about them. Concerning both these, I must take liberty
to shew how the speech has been invaded, and eaten up
by intrusion, much of which hath been about churches
and their sites, as well as by neglectful inobservation; for
those Saxon saints have hungrily eaten up the antient names,
which, when they could not well digest for hardness of the
words, many catched up others from those whom they
fieigned to be the tutelaries of those places, churches, and
fountains, and supposed miracles wrought thereabouts, as
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kaine, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gurrion, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Tudy, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ive, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Endellion,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kue, Landulph, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ust, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Marthren, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mardren’s Well,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span> (which is a parish west to the
Mount) a fresh true story of two persons, both of them
lame and decrepit, thus recovered from their infirmity.
These two persons, after they had applied themselves to
divers physicians and chirurgeons for cure, and finding no
success by them, they resorted to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mardren’s Well, and
according to the ancient custom, which they had heard of,
the same which was once in a year, to wit, on Corpus
Christi evening, to lay some small offering on the altar
there, and to lie on the ground all night, drink of the
water there, and in the morning after, to take a good
draught more, and to take and carry away some of the
water, each of them in a bottle, at their departure. This
course these two men followed, and within three weeks
they found the effect of it, and by degrees their strength
increasing, were able to move themselves on crutches.
The year following they take the same course again, after
which they were able to go with the help of a stick; and
at length one of them, John Thomas, being a fisherman,
was, and is able at this day, to follow his fishing craft.
The other, whose name was William Cork, was a soldier
<!--216.png--><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pageno">210</span>
under the command of my kinsman, Colonel William
Godolphin, (as he has often told me) was able to perform
his duty, and died in the service of his majesty King
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> But herewith take also this: one Mr. Hutchens,
a person well known in those parts, and now lately dead,
being parson of Ludgvan, a near neighbouring parish to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mardren’s Well, he observing that many of his parishioners
often frequented this well superstitiously, for which
he reproved them privately, and sometimes publicly in his
sermons; but afterwards, he the said Mr. Hutchens, meeting
with a woman coming from the well with a bottle in
her hand, desired her earnestly that he might drink thereof,
being then troubled with cholical pains, which accordingly
he did, and was eased of his infirmity. The latter story
is a full confutation of the former, for if the taking the
water accidentally thus prevailed upon the party to his
cure, as it is likely it did, then the miracle which was
intended to be by the ceremony of lying on the ground
and offering, is wholly fled, and it leaves the virtue of the
water to be the true cause of the cure. And we have here,
as in many places of the land, great variety of salutary
springs, which have diversity of operations, which by
natural reason have been found to be productive of good
effects, and not by miracle, as the vain fancies of monks
and friars have been exercised in heretofore.</p>

<p>Howbeit, there are some old names yet remaining of
places of prayers or oratories, and the ruins shewing them
to be such, as V. Gr. Paderda, which is prayers good, (of
which many places are so named); Eglarose, the church in
the vale, supposed antienter than the names of their
churches. Their sites are eminent and ancient, standing
towards the east, though no mention made how they came
to be in decay, but supposed to be after the Saxon churches
came to be erected, and miracles supposed to be wrought
by those whose names they bear. Churches’ sites took
new names, whereas the old Cornish names remain in all
other places of the parishes generally; yet the names of
the four old castles remain, and of manors also for the
most part, and some other things in the Cornish, and do
so continue the better, by reason of men’s particular interest
in them: and so are the eminent hills likewise, especially
towards the sea, and the hundred or hamlet names
of the country remain so chiefly in the western parts; those
on the eastern, standing towards the borders, have their
<!--217.png--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
names wrested away by neighbourhood, as are other things
by like accidents in the eastern parts of the county; other
names have been encroached upon by fantastical or vainglorious
builders calling their houses after their own names,
and others upon vain toys; but these are not many. Moreover,
concerning the loss of our speech, and the names of
families, I must here (but tenderly though) blame the incuriosity
of some of our gentry; who, forsaking the etymologies
of their own speech, have studied out new derivations of
their names, endeavouring to make themselves as it were
descended from French or Norman originals, in adopting
or adapting their names thereunto; whereas, their own
names in the Cornish are more honourable, genuine, and
true; from the Conquest, forsooth, those would have their
descent, (no illustrious thing in itself) whereas the ancestry
of many of them have been here long before. How finely
many have cozened themselves thereby, might be shewn,
if it would not be offensively taken, by taking up of coat
armour as from French originals. The art of heraldry
hath been drawn out to us in French terms and trickings,
mostly begun when our kings had most to do in
those parts, and so from thence it hath continued ever
since; and our Cornish gentry, finding the English so
much addicted thereunto, have followed in that tract the
same mode, and would fain have themselves understood
such, when they were much better before than those
French or Latin terms could make them, in which many
of the English may be blamed as well as we; for the
herald’s art hath many mysteries in it under their French
and Latin terms, and many mistakes may be thereby to
us and others who are not well acquainted with them, but
in those that concern our own tongue, it is evident many
have wronged themselves, and more may do so if not well
heeded.</p>

<p>The grounds of two mistakes are very obvious. 1st.
Upon the Tre or Ter. <abbr title="secondly">2dly</abbr>. Upon the Ross or Rose.
Tre or Ter in Cornish commonly signifies a town, or rather
place, and it has always an adjunct with it. Tri is the
number. 3. Those men willingly mistake one for another;
and so in French heraldry terms, they use to fancy and
contrive those with any such three things as may be like
or cohere with, or may be adapted to any thing or things
in their surnames; whether very handsome or not, is not
much stood upon. Another usual mistake is upon Ross,
<!--218.png--><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
which, as they seem to fancy, should be a rose; but Ross
in Cornish is a vale or valley. Now for this their French-Latin
tutors, when they go into the field of Mars, put
them in their coat armour prettily to smell out a rose or
flower (a fading honour instead of a durable one); so any
three such things, agreeable perhaps a little to their
names, are taken up and retained from abroad, when their
own at home have a much bttter scent and more lasting.</p>

<p>Some, however, amongst us, have kept themselves better
to the antiquities of their Cornish names in their coat
armour, as that honourable family Godolphin,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span> in keeping
still displayed abroad his white eagle, from the Cornish
Gothulgon. Richard, king of the Romans, Emperor elect,
supplied his Cornish border with silver (perhaps tin)
plates, deducing them from the antient earls of Cornwall,
as borne by them before the Norman Conquest, and, in
honour to them and himself, still bearing the same afterwards.
Chiverton, whose name in Cornish is a house on
a green place or hill, he beareth a coat thereunto accordant,
a castle with a green field under it; which may be well
thought on as to the name in<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span> Cornish, though, in the
heraldry it had been more complete. V. a castle A. as I
apprehend; Scaberius, which is sweepers or sweeping,
A. 3 broom besoms V.; Gavergan, a goat; Keverel, a he-goat,
or he-goats; that creature taking most delight, as
it is observed, in the cliffs thereabout. These are better
significations taken from home, than the other that are
foreign; and yet the assumption of a coat from any particular
act of a man’s own, is better than such as have
reference barely to names, without some special signification
therewith.</p>

<p>I had thoughts formerly, and made preparation to give
many more instances, where many amongst us have been
mistaken in those two particulars; but since it is a hard
thing to convince men of old errors, and a harder to make
a question against any concerning their gentelicions and
the old forms thereof, though intended more for their
honour, I shall forbear the further prosecution thereof;
but in this, however, I shall do them right, that they, i. e.
their ancestors, in this way thus trodden, have walked
<!--219.png--><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
generally as antiently as any other gentry of this nation,
and to my seeming, it had been better if they had stood
still <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">super vias antiquas avorum suorum</i>, since most of
those ancient families who have strayed abroad as aforesaid,
have yet some of them, and many more had, lands and
places of their own names in their possession long enjoyed;
and a nearer passage it had been to their journey’s end, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
their honour, if they had not adventured abroad: a testimony
whereof we have in that great contention which
happened in the time of King Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> between Carminow
of this county (a family to which most of the
ancient gentry here have relation) and a great person<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span> of
the nation, for bearing of one and the same coat armour,
Azure, a bend Or. After many heats about it, a reference
was made of it by the king to the most eminent Knights
of that time, of which John of Gaunt, King of Castille,
was one, before whom Carminow proved his right by the
continual bearing thereof, and that before the Conquest,
which was not disapproved nor disallowed, but applauded:
yet, because the other contendant was a baron of the
realm, Carminow was adjudged to bear the same coat
still, but a file in chief for distinction sake. The decision
was no way dishonourable, and the remembrance of the
contention continued to the glory of his posterity, to
which his motto in Cornish seems to have an allusion &mdash;in
English, “A Straw for Whifflers or Dissemblers;” or as
some have said to be, “A Fig Cala Rag Whetlow;” but we
may take the same better, I think, from the very name of
Carminow being in Cornish a rock immoveable, as a sign
of his resolution, from thence, or formerly taken up.</p>

<p>Having gone through this passage, which I know not
how it may be taken by my countrymen, let me make this
observation, that since the gentry here have thought fit,
or endeavoured by mistake, to forsake the antiquity of
their Cornish names, and thereby their greatest interest,
might perhaps prognosticate that their language, which
was their ancient glory, should in revenge forsake them, as
now it hath almost done; and I shall proceed to assign
some other causes of the decay thereof.</p>

<p><abbr title="Eleven">XI.</abbr> The vicinity, or near neighbourhood with Devon.
I may say that vicinity only with the Devonians, we having
none else, which next to the corruption of tongues by
<!--220.png--><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
time and superstition to saints, hath most devoured the
names of places, especially on the borders of Cornwall with
Devon; and there is the worst language commonly spoken,
and spoken rudely too, which corrupts not only their own
country tongue but ours also, in the places that are nearest
to them, and those infect others nearest to them. The
names of the places are thereby also much altered in the
Cornish, which antiently they had generally, and the particulars
that do yet appear, do stand as marks only to
shew that what were formerly had are now much eaten
away, on the borders especially. ’Tis observed also elsewhere
in this county furthest west, where the Cornish
hath been most spoken, that the English thereabouts
is much better than the same is in Devon, or the places
bordering on them, by being most remote from thence
from whence the corruption proceeds.</p>

<p><abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr> Our gentry, and others, antiently kept themselves
in their matches unmixt, commonly at home in their
own country, both sons and daughters desiring much to
do so, whereby they preserved their names here, and races
the better; and when their names changed, it hath been
observed to be to the places of their abode, sometimes
willingly, sometimes by accident. So it hath continued
the Cornish names to the places, and consequently the
tongue. But indeed of late our gentry have frequently
sought out foreign marriages in other counties, whereby,
though it may be confessed they have brought in much
wealth, and have goodly inheritances abroad, yet their
offsprings have been dissipated, and their affection less
intire to the county, the country-men, and country speech;
yet it is to be observed, that not many of them have been
very prosperous or of long continuance in other counties,
where they cannot muster up very many of our names of
gentry, Prideaux, Trevilian, Tregonwell, Penruddock, and
a few others excepted, which shews that our Cornish are
like those trees that thrive best and live longest in their
own peculiar soil and air, which yet is fruitful and durable
to those that come in amongst us. Not only gentry,
which are very many, that have great inheritance by their
matches here with Cornish families, but many others also,
which seldom leave this country when they have been
planted here.</p>

<p><abbr title="Thirteen">XIII.</abbr> The coming-in of strangers of all sorts upon us,
artificers, traders, home-born and foreigners, whom our
<!--221.png--><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
great commodities of tin (more profitable to others than
ourselves) and fishing, have invited to us to converse with,
and often to stay with us; these all, as they could not
easily learn our tongue, for which they could not find any
guide or direction, especially in these latter days, nor the
same generally spoken or affected amongst ourselves, so
they were more apt and ready to let loose their own
tongues to be commixed with ours, and such, for the
novelty sake thereof, people were more ready to receive
than to communicate ours to any improvement to them.
But ministers in particular have much decreased the
speech; this country being far from academies, strangers
from other parts of the kingdom have sought, as they still
do, and have had their promotions here, where benefices
are observed to be very good, and those have left their
progenies, and thereby their names, remaining behind
them, whereby the Cornish names have been diminished,
as the tongue also: so that, as the reputed saints heretofore
where they seated themselves, have robbed the places
where their churches now stand for the most part of the
Cornish names they had before, so the ministers since
those times coming from other places, and other strangers,
have filled up in many places the inhabitants and places
here with their new names and titles brought amongst us,
to the loss of many of the old. Here too we may add
what wrong another sort of strangers have done to us,
especially in the civil wars, and in particular by destroying
of Mincamber, a famous monument, being a rock of
infinite weight, which, as a burden, was laid upon other
great stones, and yet so equally thereon poised up by
nature only, as a little child could instantly move it, but
no one man or many remove it. This natural monument
all travellers that came that way desired to behold;
but in the time of Oliver’s usurpation, when all
monumental things became despicable, one Shrubsall,
one of Oliver’s heroes, then governor of Pendennes, by
labour and much ado caused to be undermined and thrown
down, to the great grief of the country, but to his own
great glory as he thought, doing it as he said, with a
small cane in his hand. I myself have heard him to boast
of this act, being a prisoner then under him.</p>

<p><abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr> Another cause I shall mention as a great loss of
the tongue, though it be a great and wonderful advantage
<!--222.png--><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
to the people otherwise: the orders of the church and
state, commanding all the people young to learn the Lord’s
Prayer, Belief, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> in the vulgar tongue, supposing that to
be intended the English, if a mother, surely a stepmother
to us. Younglings take in that most, and retain longest,
wherewith they are seasoned and bred up in their education.</p>

<p>Herein we must complain also of another new neglect
to our speech, that the like care was not taken for us as
for our brethren in Wales, in the making of the late act of
Parliament for the uniformity of the Common Prayer, by
which the five Bishops for Wales were commanded to see
the Service Book to be printed in the Welch tongue. If
it had been so here it had been a good counterpoise for
the loss formerly mentioned concerning the young people;
this might also perhaps have saved us some labour in this
our undertaking, and it would have been of good use for
some of our<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span> old folks also, for we have some among these
few that do speak Cornish, who do not understand a word
of English, as well as those in Wales, and those may be
many in some of the western parts, to whom Mr. Francis
Robinson, parson of Landawednack told me, he had
preached a sermon not long since in the Cornish tongue,
only well understood by his auditory. This should have
been taken into consideration by our gentlemen burgesses
in that and other Parliaments, and by our bishops also;
but better it had been if our ancient bishops when they
fled hither from their invaders, had brought with them a
character of their ancient speech, or left books written
therein; or, in defect thereof, they or any other had done
for us as Ulphius the bishop did for the Goths when they
came to be seated in Italy, who there invented new Gothic
letters for his people, and translated the Holy Scriptures
into that language for them. This indeed had deserved
<!--223.png--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
our greatest thanks from our bishops, as no doubt they
had them from those persons who received so great a
benefit by their former and latter kindness therein; nor
let that good old bishop Ulphius be censured (as he
seems to be) for doing a superfluous work, because he
might perhaps know that the then service of the church
was celebrated in the Greek and Latin tongues, but rather
let him be commended for his zeal in religion, and his
love to his country and to his country people then with
him, dwelling with strangers in another land, that continued
so mindful of them and their speech, as we have
been neglectful of ours. He by that means continued
that tongue in use; we by his example might have regained
ours, if the like care had been taken; but our people, as I
have heard, in Queen Elizabeth’s time, desired that the Common
Liturgy should be in the English tongue, to which they
were then for novelty’s sake affected, not out of true
judgment desired it. But, besides negligence, fatality is to
be considered; fatality is a boundary beyond which nothing
can pass; it hath been eminent in kingdoms and
states, and those have had commonly fatal periods, as to a
time determined five hundred years commonly. But
more usual it is, that upon such mutations of kingdoms
there have happened losses and mutations of tongues; it
may therefore be the more wondered at, that this of the
British, being none of the learned tongues to which the
Lord had intrusted the writing of his Sacred Scriptures,
should have here lasted so long through so many mutations,
and that there is yet such a record thereof, as our
old manuscript imports, with the purity of the doctrine
therein contained, and some other small things in the
Bodleian Library.</p>

<p><abbr title="Fifteen">XV.</abbr> The little or no help, rather discouragement, which
the gentry and other people of our own have given in
these latter days, who have lived in those parts where the
tongue hath been in some use. In the time of the late
unhappy civil war, we began to make some use of it upon
the runnagates that went from us to the contrary part from
our opposite works, and more we should have done if the
enemy had not been jealous of them, and prevented us.
This may be fit to be improved into somewhat, if the like
occasion happen, for it may be talked freely and aloud to
advantage, to which no other tongue hath reference. The
poorest sort at this day, when they speak it as they come
<!--224.png--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
abroad, are laughed at by the rich that understand it not,
which is by their own fault in not endeavouring after it.</p>

<p><abbr title="Sixteen">XVI.</abbr> The want of writing it is the great cause of its
decay; for, though there wanted a proper character for it,
yet we might have written it in the character now in use,
but I never saw a letter written in it from one gentleman
to another, or by any scholar; which is to be wondered at,
and blamed as a thing unbecoming such as ought to be
studious in every thing that is ancient: but since I began
to set about this work, I prevailed upon those that translated
it to write me several letters, which they at first
found very hard to be done; but after some practice it
seemed easier.</p>

<p>Here I cannot but lament the want of such persons,
books, records and papers, which were late in being, and
not now to be had, and my misfortune in not having translated
them, that most unhappily escaped me; one was the
manuscript of Anguin, who had translated out of Cornish
into English &mdash;&mdash; his relations, after his decease,
(having suits before me as Vice-Warden of the Stanneries
for tin bounds) promised me the favour of those translations,
but before their return to their houses, their
people tearing all about for their controverted goods,
had torn to pieces all those papers. In another place
I was promised the sight of a Cornish Accidence; but
that by another such-like accident was totally spoiled
by children before it could be brought me. I have heard
also that a Matins in Cornish was amongst the books of
Dr. Joseph Maynard, but I could never attain to it. But
besides the no helps by which I lie in this labyrinth, I
have likewise had discouragements amongst ourselves at
home. I have been often told that, besides the difficulty
of the attempt, it would be thought ridiculous for one to
go about the restoring of that tongue which he himself
could not speak nor understand truly when spoken, to
which I have made answer with these two following instances:
one is of a countryman of ours, Langford by
name; who being blind was yet able to teach others the
noble science of defence, only he desired to know still
the length of the weapon of his fellow combatant, with a
guess of his posture, and this he practised with good success.
The other is of one Grizling, of whom Mr. Camden
says, that he being deaf could see words; that is, that
notwithstanding his deafness he could answer any man’s
<!--225.png--><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
question that set at table with him by the motion of his
lips. This man I have seen also, and he would complain
of such men as in those days wore great munchadoes, as
they then called them, i. e. nourishing of much hair, by
which he was hindered somewhat of the observation of
their lips.</p>

<p>I may place these two men, one blind, the other deaf,
for these qualities among the observable things of the
county, knowing them to be true,&mdash;if the mentioning these
examples in their comparison do not excuse me from
being laughed at by those men that have censured me for
my attempt.</p>

 Here passing down the river, I would willingly have given by the way
an account of the antient Cornish name of that eminent place now called
Mount Edgcombe, but by reason that the present, and some other generations,
have been so much inclined to the name it now bears, and the other
generations before them had given it the name of West Stonehouse, as in
relation to that on the eastern side of the river East Stonehouse, where the

 Amongst which, as one of the fresh antiquities of Cornwall, let not the
old woman be forgotten, who died about two years since, who was 164 years
old, of good memory, and healthful at that age, living in the parish of Gwithian,
by the charity mostly of such as came purposely to see her, speaking
to them (in default of English) by an interpreter, yet partly understanding
it. She married a second husband after she was 80, and buried him after
he was 80 years of age. Her maiden name no one could remember, nor
perhaps she herself. She was usually called after her two husbands’ several
names severally and sometimes together, as it is usual for the meaner sort of
people to do. As for her maiden name, she might say with a wench in
Petronius, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Junonem meam iratam habeam si unquam meminerim me virginem
fuisse.”</span></p>

APPENDIX.<br /><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr></h3>

<p class="center small">WILLIAM OF WORCESTER’S ITINERARY.</p>

<p class="p2">As no account of William of Worcester is to be found
in the common Biographical Dictionaries and Encyclopedias,
it has been thought proper to prefix a short notice of
his life and character to the following extract from his
Itinerary:</p>

<p>William was the son of William of Worcester, and of
Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Bottoner. His surname
he took indifferently from either; and he is consequently
sometimes denominated William Worcester,
and William Bottoner. Bishop Tanner describes him as
descended of a knightly family, but upon what evidence
is not known; yet from certain passages in the Itinerary
his father would seem to have been a substantial householder.</p>

<p>He was born in the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James at Bristol in the
year 1415; and as he speaks of a stone vault in that city as
having been built in 1428, at his own expense, it is probable
that he lost his father, and came to his inheritance
at a very early age. Of his childhood nothing is known;
but there is some reason to suppose that he was taught
the rudiments of learning by Robert Lane, whom he has
commemorated as a very eminent schoolmaster at Bristol
when he was a youth. In 1432 he first went to Oxford,
where he was admitted of Hart Hall, now Baliol
College.</p>

<p>It is said, that he was supported at the University by
the celebrated Sir John Fastolf; the same who, in his own
day, had great renown for his valour and munificence, and
<!--229.png--><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">223</span>
who was afterwards exposed to dishonour by Shakspere,
with a trifling variation of his name, and a considerable
distortion of his character. But it may be presumed that
Worcester was indebted not so much to his bounty as to
his protection; for if we may judge of Worcester’s patrimony
from the few notices he has given us of his father’s
property in Bristol, it is not likely that his own means
would have been inadequate to the small expense of a
collegiate course in those simple times; and we may
therefore believe, that the connection which subsisted
between Worcester and Fastolf, was merely a compliance
with the general custom of the age, when youths of
gentlemanly birth and competent fortune sought the
patronage and entered the household of wealthy and
powerful men. But, however this might have been, it is
certain that he afterwards lived with Sir John at Caister,
in Norfolk, where he acted as the knight’s secretary and
confidential friend, and subsequently as one of his executors.</p>

<p>At Oxford Worcester prosecuted his studies with great
diligence and success; and we are informed that he became
eminent for his knowledge of history, medicine, and
astronomy. On these subjects he is said to have written
many books: yet it is likely that they were rather extracts
and memorandums, than original and formal compositions.
Besides these, he executed some translations from the
classics; and we learn from his Itinerary, that on the
tenth of August 1473, he presented the Bishop of Winchester
with a translation of Cicero on Old Age. He tells
us, however, that this gift was not sufficient to conciliate
the good prelate’s regard; but he seems to insinuate, that
the failure was owing less to the faults of the performance,
than to the intervention of an enemy. Yet, whatever he
might have suffered from the malice of his neighbours, it
is possible, that the offering itself was considered of small
value; and it might have been the less esteemed, if it be
true, that the same treatise had been already rendered into
English by John Tiptoft, the accomplished and unfortunate
Earl of Worcester.</p>

<p>But it is on very slender evidence that this nobleman is
said to have translated Cicero on Old Age. He had left
in manuscript a translation of Cicero on Friendship; and
when Caxton printed it, many years after his death, with
an anonymous version of the essay on Old Age, in the
same volume, he was at once supposed to have been the
<!--230.png--><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
author of both; but the translation, thus published without
a name, was professedly executed in honour of Sir
John Fastolf, the friend and patron of William of Worcester;
and as it is well known that many of his dependant’s
literary performances were undertaken expressly for
his sake, and, as at the same time William of Worcester
might have been easily confounded with the Earl of Worcester,
there is considerable probability that William, and
not the Earl, was the author of the translation in question,
and consequently William could not have suffered
on a comparison with him in the manner suggested. Nor
is it sufficient objection to this inference, that the productions
of a writer, whose style has been chosen as an example
of the barbarous taste of the age in which he lived,
were not likely to be imputed to one whose extraordinary
attainments had won the admiration of the polished and
fastidious scholars of Italy; for whatever might have been
the Earl’s superiority in classical knowledge, it does not
appear that he had cultivated his native tongue with
greater care than his contemporaries; and William of
Worcester might not have fallen below him in the rude
and unsettled English of that time.</p>

<p>Of William’s writings, of whatever kind, very little is
now extant; and though for a few things the credit which
he deserved has been given to others, it has been reasonably
conjectured, that he has enjoyed in return the merit
of some performances of which he was not the author;
but however he might have laboured in the promotion of
learning, he loved the acquisition of it so well, that he
was accustomed to say, he found more pleasure in his
books than some men derived from their estates; and to
the attainments which he had made at the University, he
added, by the help of one Giles, a Lombard, some acquaintance
with French and Poetry.</p>

<p>Yet study was insufficient to satisfy him without observation:
<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">τὸ εἰδέναι δίττον ἔλεγεν εἶναι· τὸ μὲν ἐπιστήμῃ, τὸ
δὲ τῇ πείρᾳ.</span> He consequently sought to enlarge his knowledge
by travelling; and he has been considered worthy of
respect as the earliest topographer of England, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Primum
Angliæ perlustratorem ne flocci facias;”</span> but however this
may be, he is certainly the first traveller who has left us
any memorials of a journey into Cornwall; and the interest
and value which his observations derive from this
<!--231.png--><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>
circumstance, have made them worthy of a place in the
present Appendix.</p>

<p>The book, in which these notices are found, is entitled
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Itinerarium, sive Liber Rerum Memorabilium Willelmi
Botoner dict. de Worcester</cite>. It had existed in manuscript
only, till the year 1778, when it was published at Cambridge,
from the original autograph in the Library of
Corpus Christi College, by James Nasmith, formerly a
Fellow of that Society. Besides this, indeed, there is
another manuscript of the journal in the same library,
but it is only a copy of the former, made by the procurement
of Archbishop Parker; and as it is very incorrect, it
is of no value in itself, and could have been of little use to
the editor.</p>

<p>This Itinerary seems to have been a memorandum book,
which the author kept with him on his journeys, not only
into this county, but to other parts of this kingdom; and
accordingly we find it stored with desultory notices of
separate facts, and distant places, and abounding with
trifling and unconnected observations, which seem to have
been associated on the same page, only as the book was
accidentally opened, and recorded rather from some present
impulse, than with any settled and ultimate design.
Nothing can be more rude than the style, or more worthless
than many of the statements; and whatever might
have been the writer’s real intention, it is very certain that
his remarks, in the condition which they have actually
come down to us, could not have been meant for publication.
It might have been his purpose, when leisure and
opportunity should serve, to arrange and expand the
hasty and unconnected notes thus made by the way; but
the brevity of the greater number would have insufficiently
secured him against perplexities and mistakes; and as he
might have erred occasionally through the acknowledged
failure of his memory, or the unconscious influence of his
imagination, it is possible that a careful and regular
composition subsequently made, might have been less
useful, than even the confused and scanty memorandums
we possess.</p>

<p>Worcester came into Cornwall in the year 1478. Mr.
Whitaker says, that it was in 1440. How he could have
committed such a mistake, it is difficult to conceive, as
the date is expressly recorded in the Itinerary itself. Mr.
Polwhele, indeed, appears to have erred likewise; for,
<!--232.png--><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
according to him, William’s journey was performed in
1473; but this is evidently nothing more than a misprint.
In one of our county histories, the journey is stated to
have occurred in 1460: it is probable, however, that the
writer had never seen the Itinerary.</p>

<p>He set out from Norwich, on Monday the 17th of
August, and reached London on the Thursday following.
On the first of September he came to Bristol, and took
his departure for Cornwall on the next day. He arrived
at Launceston on Sunday the 13th, and on Monday pursued
his journey towards the west. Near Bodmin his
horse fell with him, but it does not appear that he received
any injury. On Tuesday night he slept at Polwhele; and
having visited the preaching friars at Truro on Wednesday,
he came in the evening to Marazion. The next
morning, Thursday 17th of September 1478, he attended
mass in the chapel on the Mount. In the afternoon of
the same day, he departed for Penryn; and going thence
to Bodmin, he returned eastward, through the towns on
the south coast. The towns and villages on the north
coast of Cornwall he did not visit; and the statements
which he makes respecting them, were merely the result
of his inquiries. He seems, indeed, to have been as
diligent in seeking information from others, as in making
observations of his own; and no persons, whether smiths,
ropers, or ferrymen, were considered unfit to furnish him
with the knowledge which he wanted for his journal.
Amongst those in Cornwall, from whom he learned most,
was his cousin, Robert Bracey, at Fowey; but it is likely
that he depended mainly upon the secular and regular
clergy, who entertained him on the road, and gave him
access to their chronicles and registers.</p>

<p>With regard to the nature and purpose of this journey,
from the manner of the record itself, it would not be easy
to conjecture, whether it was undertaken with feelings of
devotion or of curiosity. The coldness of the whole
narrative, and the careless brevity with which the accomplishment
of the acknowledged object is related, were
scarcely consistent with a fervid and lively devotion; and
the insertion of so many facts and observations, which
must have been useless when they were written, and now
owe their value to their subsequent antiquity, while the
documents of early times, and the traditions of the people,
were almost wholly neglected, could not have happened
<!--233.png--><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">227</span>
under the influence of an active and judicious curiosity.
And besides this, when William of Worcester was in
Cornwall, it was impossible for an intelligent visitor to
overlook the state of our ecclesiastical architecture. Many
of our present churches had been recently built, and others
were then building; and some account of their style and
condition, of their founders and builders, and of the
circumstances attending their erection, would have been
far more amusing to his contemporaries than what he
wrote, and of unspeakable interest in after times. And
any other man, we may suppose, would have found something
to say of the manners and habits of the people, and
of their mines and fisheries; but from William of Worcester
we know only by implication or accident, that he
travelled in an inhabited country.</p>

<p>Yet without devotion he would not have visited the
Mount, and without curiosity he would have made no
observations by the way. The shrine of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael,
which had been the resort of superstitious people in
remote times, had lately recovered its ancient reputation,
after an interval of some accidental obscurity; and pilgrims
were again attracted by the privileges conferred on
it in the eleventh century, and were coming even from
distant places in considerable numbers. William of Worcester
was one of these; and as his penitence had brought
him so far, it might be thought that his admiration would
have delayed his return.</p>

<p>But the hospitalities of a place so ‘kind to strangers,’
the natural beauties of the Mount, and the venerable
antiquity and romantic traditions of the castle and monastery,
were not enough to detain him for a day; and with
scarcely any regard to such things, he stayed but a few
hours. In that short space he could not occupy himself
with many inquiries; and we have received from him
only a few bare facts, which he appears to have recorded
rather as the justification of his pilgrimage, than with any
precise knowledge of their value.</p>

<p>His subsequent pursuits, and the time of his death, are
not known, nor have we any account of the number and
the fortunes of his children. It is certain, however, that
he was married; and he is reported to have taken a wife
in opposition to the wishes of his patron. For Sir John
Fastolf had designed for him some ecclesiastical preferment,
and had consequently advised him to obtain orders

<!--238.png--><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">232</span>
ecclesiam montis Sancti Michaeli in tumba in comitatu
Cornubiæ gerens eximæ devocionis affectum, pie concessit
ecclesiæ predictæ, quæ ministerio angelico creditur et
comprobatur consecrari et sanctificari, omnibus fidelibus,
qui illam ecclesiam cum suis beneficiis et elemosinis
exepecierunt seu visitaverint, tertiam partem penetenciarum
suarum eis condonari. Et ut inconcussum et
inviolabile fine tenus permaneat; ex autoritate Dei patris
omnipotentis et Filii et Spiritus sancti omnibus successoribus
suis interdixit, ne quid contra hoc decretum usurpare
presumant. Ista verba in antiquis registris de novo
in hac ecclesia repertis inventa, prout hic in valvis ecclesiæ
publice ponuntur. Et quia pluribus istud est incognitum,
ideo nos in Christo Dei famuli et ministri hujus
ecclesiæ universitatem vestram, qui regimen animarum
possidetis, ob mutuæ vicissitudinis obtentum requirimus
et rogamus, quatenus ista publicetis in ecclesiis vestris, ut
vestri subditi et subjecti ad majorem exortacionem devocionis
attencius animentur, et locum istum gloriosius
perigrinando frequentent ad dona et indulgencias predicta
graciose consequenda.</p>

fide et morum honestate preclarus, nomine Brokannus, a
quo provincia ipsa nomen sortita nuncupatur Brokannok
usque in presentem diem; hic itaque Brokmannus, antequam
ex uxore sua Gladewysa filium vel filiam genuisset,
in Hiberniam profectus est, uxorem suam et omnia sua
relinquens; timuerat enim, ne si cum uxore sua remaneret,
generacionem ex ea procrearet, qua impediretur ne
libere Domino servire potuisset. Mansit igitur in Hibernia
24 annis, bonis operibus intendens; postea autem visitare
patriam suam volens, rediit in Walliam, ubi uxorem suam
adhuc viventem invenit. Post aliquantulum autem temporis
sicut Deus preordinaverat, licet ipse homo non proposuisset,
uxorem suam cognovit, ex qua postea 24 filios
et filias genuit. Videns Dei virtutem cui nemo resistere
potest, ait, “Jam Deus in me vindicavit quod contra disposicionem
voluntatis ejus venire frustra disposui; quia
enim 24 annis ab uxore mea ne sobolem procrearem illicitè
effugi, dedit mihi pro quolibet anno illicitæ continentiæ
sobolem unam quia jam 24 filios et filias post 24
annos ab eadem uxore suscepi.” Prædicti autem 24 filii et
filiæ, quos predictus Brokannus ex uxore sua Gladewysa
genuit, hiis nominibus vocabantur, Nectanus et cætera.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">From</span> Depeford to <span class="location">Lanstoun</span> a <abbr title="twelve">xij</abbr> miles by hilly and
much morisch groude baren of wodde. Or ever I cam to
Lanstoun by a mile I passid over a bridge of stone, having
3 arches and a [one] smaul, caullid New Bridge; thorough
the which the ryver of Tamar rennith, that almost from
the hed of it to the mouth devidith Devonshir from
Cornewaule. This New Bridge was of the making of the
Abbates of Tavestok, and mainteinyd by them; for Tavestoke
Abbay had fair possessions thereaboute.</p>

<p>The Ryver of Tamar risith a 3 miles by north-est from
Hertelande and thens cummith to Tamerton, a village on
the est ripe yn Devonshire; and ther is a bridg over
Tamar of stone: and from this bridg to Padestow <abbr title="twenty">xx</abbr>
miles. Yalme Bridge of stone 2 miles lower. New
Bridge 2 miles lower. Pulstun Bridge 2 miles lower.
Greistoun Bridge a 2 miles or more lower. Tavestoke about
a 4 miles from Greston Bridg; and Grestoun Bridg,
being about a 3 miles from Launston, is the way from
Launston to Tavestok. Hawte Bridg. Another bridg
caullid New Bridg. Caulstoke Bridg next the se, begon
by Sir Perse Eggecumbe. Lideford Bridge is not on
Tamar.</p>

<p>After that I had enterid a litle into the suburbe of
Launstoun, I passed over a brooke caullid Aterey, that
rennith yn the botom of the stepe hil that Launstoun
<!--263.png--><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">257</span>
stondith on. This water, as I there lernid, riseth a <abbr title="ten">x</abbr>
miles of by west-north-west towards Bodmyne; and,
passing by Launstoun, goith in Tamar by est, as I did
gather, a litle above Pulston Bridg. After that I had
passid over Aterey, I went up by the hille thorough the
long suburbe, ontylle I cam to the toun waul and gate,
and so passid thorough the toun, conscending the hill
ontylle I cam to the very top of it, wher the marketplace
and the paroche chirch of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Stephane, lately reedified,
be. The large and auncient Castelle of Launstun
stondith on the knappe of the hill, by south a litle from
the paroche chirch. Much of this castel yet stondith; and
the <em>moles</em> that the kepe stondith on is large and of a terrible
highth, and the <em>arx</em> of it, having 3 severale wardes,
is the strongest but not the biggest that ever I saw in any
auncient worke in Englande. Thir is a litle pirle of water
that servith the high parte of Lanstoun.</p>

<p>The Priorie of Launstoun stondith in the south-west parte
of the suburbe of the toun, under the rote of the hille, by a
fair wood side; and thorowgh this wood rennith a pirle of
water, cumming out of an hil therby, and servith al the
offices of the place. In the chirch I markid 2 notable
tumbes, one of Prior Horton, and another of Prior Stephane.
One also told me there, that one Mabilia, a
Countes, was buried ther in the Chapitre House. One
William Warwist, Bishop of Excestre, erected this Priorie,
and was after buried at Plymtoun Priory that he also
erected. Warwist, for erection of Launston Priory, suppressid
a collegiate Chirch of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Stephan having Prebendaries,
and gave the best part of the landes of it to Launstoun
Priory, and toke the residew hymself. There yet
standith a Chirch of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Stephan, about half a mile from
Launstoun on a hille, wher the Collegiate Chirch was.
Gawen Carow hath the custody of the Priory. There is
a Chapelle by a west-north-west a litle without Launstowne,
dedicate to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Catarine; it is now prophanid.</p>

<p>From Launston to Botreaux Castelle, vulgo <span class="location">Boscastel</span>,
first a 2 miles by enclosid ground having sum woodde and
good corne. Thens an 8 miles by morisch and hilly
ground and great scarsite of wood, insomuch that al the
countery therabout brennith firres and hethe. And thens
a 2 miles to Boscastel by enclosid ground metely fruteful
of corne, but exceding baren of wood, to the which the
bleke northern se is not there of nature favorable. The
<!--264.png--><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">258</span>
toun of Boscastelle lyith apon the brow of a rokky hille
by south-est, and so goith doun by lenght to the northe
toward the se, but not even ful hard to it. It is a very
filthy toun and il kept. There is a chirch in it, as I remembre
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Simpherian. The Lorde Botreaux was
lord of this town, a man of an old Cornish linage, and
had a manor place, a thing, as far as I could &mdash;&mdash;
of smaul reputation, as it is now, far onworthe the name
of a castel. The people ther caulle it the Courte. Ther
cummith down a little broke from south-est out of the
hilles therby, and so renning by the west side of the
towne, goeth into Severn se betwixt 2 hylles, and ther
maketh a pore havenet, but of no certaine salvegarde.
One of the Hungrefordes maried with one of the heires generale
of Botreaux, and so Boscastel cam to Hungreford.
Then cam Boscastelle, by an heir generale of the Hungrefords,
unto the Lord Hastinges. Hastinges Erle of Huntendune
and the late lord Hungreford had a lordship of
the Botreaux in partition, caullid <span class="location">Parke</span>; and ther is a
manor place or castelet. It is a <abbr title="six">vi</abbr> miles from Botreaux
by south.</p>

<p>Ther is no very notable toun or building from Botreaux
by est-north-est, along apon the shore upper on
Severn to Hertland point, but <span class="location">Strettoun</span>, and that is a
<abbr title="twelve">xij</abbr> miles from Botreaux, and ther is a praty market. It
stondith about a mile from the se. There is a place near
to Stretton caullid <span class="location">Ebbingford</span>, but now communely
<span class="location">Efford</span>, wher John Arundale of Trerise was borne, and
hath a fair manor place, in the which Syr John Chaumon
now dwellith, that maried the mother yet lyving of John
Arundale of Trerise.</p>

<p>Olde Treviliane, a man of pratie land, but cumming of
a younger brother of the chife house of that name, dwellith
toward Stretton, at a place caullid &mdash;&mdash;. Hertland
Point is a <abbr title="ten">x</abbr> miles upper on Severn from Strettoun.</p>

<p>From Botreaux to <span class="location">Tredewy</span> village, on the shore
about a mile, and ther cummith downe a broke rising in
the gret rokky hilles therby.</p>

<p>From Tredewi to <span class="location">Bossinny</span>, on the shore about a mile.
This Bossinny hath beene a bygge thing for a fischar
town, and hath great privileges grauntid onto it. A man
may se there the ruines of a gret numbre of houses. Here
also cummith down a broke, and this broke and Tredewy
water resort to the se at one mouth betwyxt <abbr title="two">ij</abbr> hilles,
<!--265.png--><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pageno">259</span>
wherof that that is on the est side, lyith out lyke an arme
or cape, and maketh the fascion of an havenet or pere,
whither shippelettes sumtime resorte for socour. A frere
of late dayes toke apon hym to make an haven at this
place, but he litle prevailid theryn. There ly 2 blake

This castelle hath bene a marvelus strong and notable
forteres, and almost <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">situ loci inexpugnabile</i>, especially for
the dungeon, that is on a great and high terrible cragge,
environid with the se; but having a drawbridge from the
residew of the castelle onto it. There is yet a chapel
standing withyn this dungeon of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ulette, alias Uliane.
Shepe now fede within the dungeon. The residew of the
buildings of the castel be sore wether-beten and yn ruine;
but it hath beene a large thinge. This castelle stondith in
the paroche of Trevenny; and the paroch therof is of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>

<p>Passing a mile from the chirch of <span class="location"><abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Symphorian</span> by
hilly and hethy ground, I cam over a brooke that ran from
south-est-north to Severn se, and about half a mile beyound
the mouth of this brook lay a great blak rok like
an islet yn the se not far from the shore.</p>

<p><span class="location">Porthissek</span>, a fisschar village, lyith about a 3 miles from
the mouth of th’afore sayd brook, lower by west on
Severn shore. There resortith a broke to Porthissek, and
there is a pere and sum socour for fisschar botes.</p>

<p><span class="location">Porthguin</span>, a fisschar village, lyith a 2 miles lower on

And a 3 miles lower is the mouth of Padestow Haven.
From Dindagelle to S. Esse village a 4 miles; meately good
ground about S. Esses selfe. From S. Esse to Trelille
village 2 miles. From Trelille to &mdash;&mdash; wher
Master Carniovies, alias Carnsey, hath a praty house, fair
ground, and praty wood about it.</p>

<p>Thens 3 miles by good corne grounde, but no wood, to
<span class="location">Wadebridge</span>. Wher as now Wadebridge is, ther was a
fery a 80 yeres syns, and menne sumtyme passing over by
horse, stoode often in great jeopardie.</p>

<p>Then one Lovebone, vicar of Wadebridge, movid with
pitie, began the bridge, and with great paine and studie,
good people putting their help thereto, finishid it with

<abbr title="seventeen">xvij</abbr> fair and great uniforme arches of stone. One told me
that the fundation of certein of tharches was first sette on
so quick sandy ground that Lovebone almost despairid to
performe the bridg ontyl such tyme as he layed pakkes of
wolle for fundation.</p>

<p>The ryver of Alawne rennith thorough Wadebridge,
evidentley seen at lower.</p>

<p>The first memorable bridge on Alane is caullid Helham
Bridge &mdash;&mdash; miles lower then Camilforde, but Alane is
almost a mile from Camilford Toun.</p>

<p>Dunmere Bridge of 3 arches a 2 miles lower. Here
doth Alaune ryver ren within a mile of Bodmyn.</p>

<p>Wadebridge a 3 miles lower by land and 4 by water.
This is the lowest bridg on Alane.</p>

<p>Ther cummith a broke from S. Esse 5 myles from
Wadebridge, and a litle above Wadebridge goith into
Alane by the est side of the haven. This broke risith a
2 miles above S. Esse by est-north-est. There cummith
a brooke from Mr. Carnsey’s house, and goith into Alane,
by the est side of the haven a 3 miles lower than Wadebridge:
and here is a creeke at the mouth of this brooke
that ebbith and flowith up into the land.</p>

<p>In the way passing from Dunmere Bridge toward Bodmyn,
there rennith a praty broket thoroug a bridge of one
stone arche, a very litle way beyond Dunmer Bridge: and
a litle lower goith into Alane bynethe Dunmer Bridge by
the west ripe of Alane. This litle broke servith the milles,
and rennith by the est ende of the town of Bodmyn.</p>

<p>There cummith a brooke into Alaune about a 2 miles
byneth Dunmere bridg on the west ripe. This brooke
riseth by south-est: and at S. Lawrence, scant a mile owt
of Bodmyn, I passid over a bridge on this water in the
way to Michale.</p>

<p>From Wadebridge to <span class="location">Padestow</span>, a good quick fischar
toun but onclenly kepte, a 4 miles. This toun is auncient,
bering the name of Lodenek in Cornische, and yn Englisch,
after the trew and old writinges, Adelstow, Latine <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Athelstani

for the chief gever of privileges vnto it. The paroch
Chirch of Padestow is of S &mdash;&mdash;. There use many
Britons with smaul shippes to resorte to Padestow with
commoditees of their countery and to by fische. The
toun of Padestow is ful of Irisch men. Padestow is set
on the weste side of the haven. Padestow toun is a &mdash;&mdash;

<p>From Wadebridge to Dunmere a 3 miles, and thens a mile
to <span class="location">Bodmyn</span>. Bodmyn hath a market on every Saturday,
lyke a fair for the confluence of people. The showe and the
principale of the toun of Bodmyn is from west to est along
in one streate. There is a chapel of <abbr title="Saint">S</abbr> &mdash;&mdash; at the west
ende of the toune. The paroch chirch standith at the est
end of the town and is a fair large thyng. There is a
cantuarie chapel at th’est ende of it. The late Priory of
Blake Chanons stoode at the est ende of the paroch chirchyard
of Bodmyne. <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Petrocus was Patrone of this, and
sumtyme dwellyd ther. There hath bene monkes, then
nunnys, then seculare prestes, then monkes agayn, and last
canons regular, in <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Petrokes chirch. Willyam Warlewist,
Bishop of Excestre, erectid the last fundation of this
Priory; and had to hymself part of th’auncient landes of
Bodmyn monasterie. I saw no tumbes in the Priory very
notable, but Thomas Vivianes, late Prior ther, and Suffragane
by the title of the Bishoprike of Megarensis.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_44" id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span> The
Shrine and Tumbe of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Petrok yet stondith in th’est part
of the chirche. There was a good place of Gray Freres
in the south side of Bodmyn town. One John of London,
a merchaunt, was the beginner of this house. Edmund
Erle of Cornewaul augmentid it. There lay buried in the
Gray Freres Sir Hugh and Sir Thomas Peverelle, knightes,
and benefactors to the house. There is another Chapel in
Bodmyn beside that in the west ende of the toune, and an
Almose House, but not endowid with landes.</p>

<p>From Bodmyn to <span class="location"><abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Laurence</span>, wher a poor Hospital or
Lazar House is, about a mile. One of the Peverelles gave
a litle annuitie onto this house. Here I passid over a stone
bridge, and under it rennith a praty broke that cummith
out of the hylles from south-este, and goith into Alane
a 2 miles above Padestow by the weste ripe, and by the
meanes of the se and creke it ebbith and flowith up into
the creke of this river. From <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Laurence I passed by

<p>There was a castel caullid <span class="location">Carnhangives</span>, as apperith, or
manor place, now clene doun, not far from the bridg.
Dinham, as sum say, was lord of this place, and to the
court thereof be longging many knightes and gentilmens
services.</p>

<p>The toune of <span class="location">Lannant</span> [now <span class="location">Lelant</span>] is praty. The

<p><abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Fës [<span class="location"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ive’s</span>] a 2 miles or more from Lannant. The
place that the chief of the toun hath and partely dooth
stonde yn, is a very peninsula, and is extendid into the se
of Severn as a cape. This peninsula, to compace it by
the rote, lakkith litle of a mile. Most part of the houses
in the peninsula be sore oppressid or overcoverid with
sandes, that the stormy windes and rages castith up there.
This calamite hath continued ther litle above 20 yeres.
<!--274.png--><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pageno">268</span>
The best part of the toun now standith in the south part
of the peninsula, up toward another hille, for defence from
the sandes. There is a blok house and a fair pere in the
est side of the peninsula; but the pere is sore chokid
with sande. The paroch chirch is of Iva, a nobleman’s
daughter of Ireland, and disciple of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Barricus. Iva and
Elwine, with many other, cam into Cornewaul, and landid
at Pendinas. This Pendinas is the peninsula and stony
rok wher now the toun of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ives stondith. One Dinan,
a great lord in Cornewaul, made a chirch at Pendinas, at
the requist of Iva, as it is written yn <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ive’s legende.</p>

<p>Ther is now at the very point of <span class="location">Pendinas</span> a chapel of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Nicolas, and a <em>pharos</em> for lighte for shippes sailing by
night in those quarters. The town of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ive’s is servid
with fresch water of brokettes that rise in the hilles
thereby. The late Lord Brook was lord of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ive’s, now

after, the mouth is barrid again with sande. At other
tymes the superfluite of the water of Lo Poole drenith
out thorough the sandy barre into the se. If this barre

in the midle whereof was a bridge having but one arche.
It flowith above this bridge; and at the ebbe there resortith
a broke thourough this bridge, that cummith down

of Fawey haven is a square toure of stone for defence of
the haven, made about King Edward the 4. tym; and
litle above this tower on the same side is <span class="location">Fawey</span> Town,
lying alonge the shore, and builded on the side of a great
slatey rokkid hille. In the midle of the toun apon the shore
self is a house buildid quadrantly in the haven, which
shadowith the shippes in the haven above it from 3 partes
of the haven mouth, and defendith them from stormes.
The name of the toun of Fawey is in Cornisch Conwhath.
It is set on the north side of the haven, and is set hangging
on a maine rokky hille, and is in length about a
quarter of a mile. The towne longgid to one Cardinham,
a man of great fame, and he gave it to Tywartraith Priorie,
of the which sum say that Cardinham was founder; sum
say Campernulph of Bere. But at this gift Fawey was
but a smaul fischar toun. The paroch chirch of Fawey is
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Fimbarrus, and was impropriate to the priorie of
Tywartraith. The glorie of Fawey rose by the warres
in King Edward the first and the thirde and Henry the
<abbr title="fifth">v.</abbr> day, partely by feates of warre, partely by pyracie, and
so waxing riche felle al to marchaundice, so that the town
was hauntid with shippes of diverse nations, and their
shippes went to all nations. The shippes of Fawey sayling
by Rhie and Winchelsey, about Edward the 3. tyme, wold
vale no bonet beyng requirid; wherapon Rhy and Winchelsey
men and they faught, when Fawey men had victorie,
and therapon bare the armes mixt with the armes of
Rhy and Winchelsey, and then rose the name of the
‘Gallaunts of Fawey.’ The French men diverse tymes
assailid this town, and last most notably about Henry the
<abbr title="sixth">vj.</abbr> tyme, when the wife of Thomas Treury the 2. with her
men repellid the French out of her house in her housebandes
absence. Wherapon, Thomas Treury buildid a
right fair and stronge embatelid tower in his house, and
embateling all the waulles of the house, in a maner made
it a castelle, and onto this day it is the glorie of the town
building in Faweye. In Edwarde the 4. day, 2. stronge
towers were made a litle beneth the town, one on eche
side of the haven, and a chayne to be drawen over.
When warre in Edward the 4 dayes seasid bytwene the
<!--283.png--><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">277</span>
French men and Englisch, the men of Fawey, usid to pray
[spoil], kept their shippes and asaillid the Frenchmen in the
sea agayn King Edwardes commandement; wherapon the
capitaines of the shippes of Fawey were taken and sent to
London, and Dertemouth men commaunded to fetche their
shippes away, at which tyme Dertmouth men toke them
in Fawy, and toke away, as it is said, the great chein that
was made to be drawen over the haven from towre to
towre.</p>

<p>From Fawey town end by north in the haven is Chagha
mille pille, a litle uppeward on the same side. A good
mile above Chagha mille pille is on this west side Bodmyn
pille, having [a landing place] for wares, then to be caried
to Bodmyn.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile from Bodmyn creek mouth up

armes cum again to one botom. The great part of Fawey
water is by policie turnid from the ston bridg for choking
of it, and for to put the sande of from the botom of the
toun. The stone bridge, in tyme of memorie of men
lyving, was of arches very depe to the sight; the sande is
now cum to within a 4 or 5 feete of the very hedde of

libertees long to this castelle. The Valetortes, men of
great possession, wer owners, and, as far as I can gather,
builders of this castel, and owners and lordes of the toun
of Aische.</p>

<p>These crekes I notid on the west side of Tamar. Fyrst,
I markid in sight above Asche toun, a 2 miles or more,
the principal arme of Tamar haven going up into the land
about a 10 miles from that place to Caulstoke bridge,
witherto it almost ebbith and flowith. And shippes cum
up within a mile of this bridg to a place caullid Morleham.
And this place is but a 3 miles from Tavestoke. Tavestoke
is countid to be but 10 miles from Asche to go the

arme of Tamar in sight I markid, descending in the haven,
3 crekes breking out into the land, wherof the first lyith

APPENDIX.<br /><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></h3>

<p class= "center">DRAYTON’S POLY-OLBION.&mdash;CORNWALL.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Michael Drayton</span> was born of a gentleman’s family
in Warwickshire in the year 1563. His ancestors are
said to have migrated from Drayton in Lancashire.</p>

<p>Michael exhibited a strong genius for poetry at an early
age. He studied at Oxford, but without taking a degree.
In 1588 he appears to have served in a military capacity;
as he describes the glorious victory over the Invincible
Armada, as seen by himself, from the shore near
Dover. He died in 1631, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>Mr. Drayton was a very voluminous writer of Poetry.
We have from him &mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Heroic Epistles after the model of Ovid.</li>

<li>The Barons’ Wars in the Reign of Edward the Second.</li>

<li>The Battle of Agincourt.</li>

<li>The Shepherd’s Garland.</li>

<li>Elegies.</li>

<li>The Man in the Moon, the Owl, Odes, and various
other small Poems.</li>
</ul>

<p>But his greatest work is the Poly-Olbion, in twenty
Cantos or Songs, of which the first is here given, with
the Author’s Notes or Illustrations, as it contains a description
of Cornwall, commencing with a Dialogue
between <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount and the Bar of Hayle, which
<!--300.png--><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pageno">294</span>
must have passed immediately over Tredrea the Editor’s
House.</p>

<p>The singular title of his great work is derived from the
Greek Πόλυς many and also very; and Ολβιὸς happy;
some neuter substantive understood, perhaps the Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regnum</i>; and founded on one of the idle fancies current in
the middle ages, which derived Albion (a name of this
island) in some way or another from Ολβιὸς.</p>

<p class="p2">Michael Drayton commences his national poem with
the western point of the Country, and his First Song is as
follows:</p>

  <div class="i0">Some sitting on the beach to prune their painted breasts,</div>

  <div class="i0">The bourns, the brooks, the becks, the rills, the rivulets,</div>

  <div class="i0">That streightned tongue of land, where at Mount-Michael’s bay,</div>

  <div class="i0">Rude Neptune cutting in, a cantle forth doth take;</div>

  <div class="i0">A<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_60" id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span> chersonese thereof, the corner clipping in;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where to th’industrious Muse the Mount doth thus begin:</div>
  <div class="i2">‘Before thou further pass, and leave this setting shore,</div>
  <div class="i0">‘Whose towns unto the saints that lived here of yore</div>
  <div class="i0">‘(Their fasting, works and pray’rs, remaining to our shames)</div>
  <div class="i0">‘Were rear’d, and justly call’d by their peculiar names,</div>
  <div class="i0">‘The builders honour still; this due and let them have,</div>
  <div class="i0">‘As deign to drop a tear upon each holy grave;</div>
  <div class="i0">‘Whose charity and zeal, instead of knowledge stood:</div>
  <div class="i0">‘For surely in themselves they were right simply good.</div>
  <div class="i0">‘If credulous too much, thereby th’ offended heaven,</div>
  <div class="i0">‘In their devout intents yet be their sins forgiven.’</div>
  <div class="i0">Then from his rugged top the tears down trickling fell;</div>
  <div class="i0">And in his passion stirr’d, again began to tell</div>
  <div class="i0">Strange things, that in his days time’s course had brought to pass:</div>
  <div class="i0">That forty miles now sea, sometimes firm fore-land was;</div>
  <div class="i0">And that a forest then, which now with him is flood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whereof he first was call’d the Hoar-rock in the wood;</div>
  <div class="i0">Relating then how long this soil had laid forlorn,</div>
  <div class="i0">As that her Genius now had almost her forsworn,</div>
  <div class="i0">And of their ancient love did utterly repent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sith to destroy herself that fatal tool she lent,</div>
  <div class="i0">To which th’ insatiate slave her intrails out doth draw,</div>
  <div class="i0">That thrusts his gripple hand into her golden maw;</div>
  <div class="i0">And for his part doth wish, that it were in his pow’r</div>
  <div class="i0">To let the ocean in, her wholly to devour.</div>
  <div class="i2">Which Hayle doth overhear, and much doth blame his rage;</div>
  <div class="i0">And told him (to his teeth) he doated with his age.</div>
  <div class="i0">For Hayle (a lusty nymph, bent all to amorous play,</div>
  <div class="i0">And having quick recourse into the Severn sea,</div>
  <div class="i0">With Neptune’s pages oft disporting in the deep;</div>
  <div class="i0">One never touch’d with care, but how herself to keep</div>
  <div class="i0">In excellent estate) doth thus again intreat;</div>
  <div class="i0">‘Muse, leave the wayward Mount to his distemper’d heat,</div>

  <div class="i0">‘Who varieth them in forms, both curiously and oft;</div>
  <div class="i0">‘Which for she (wanting power) produceth them too soft,</div>
  <div class="i0">‘That virtue which she could not liberally impart,</div>
  <div class="i0">‘She striveth to amend by her own proper art.</div>
  <div class="i0">‘Besides the sea-holm here, that spreadeth all our shore,</div>

  <div class="i0">‘That generally approv’d both far and near is sought;</div>
  <div class="i0">‘And our Main-Amber here, and Burien trophy, thought</div>
  <div class="i0">‘Much wrong’d, nor yet prefer’d for wonders with the rest.’</div>
  <div class="i2">But the laborious muse, upon her journey prest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus uttereth to herself; ‘To guide my course aright,</div>
  <div class="i0">‘What mound or steddy mere is offered to my sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">‘Upon this out-strecht arm, whilst sailing here at ease,</div>
  <div class="i0">‘Betwixt the southern waste, and the Sabrinian seas,</div>
  <div class="i0">‘I view those wanton brooks, that waxing still do wane;</div>
  <div class="i0">‘That scarcely can conceive, but brought to bed again;</div>
  <div class="i0">‘Scarce rising from the spring, (that is their natural mother)</div>
  <div class="i0">‘To grow into a stream, but buried in another.’</div>
  <div class="i0">When Chore doth call her on, that wholly doth betake</div>
  <div class="i0">Herself unto the Loo; transform’d into a lake,</div>
  <div class="i0">Through that impatient love she had to entertain</div>
  <div class="i0">The lustful Neptune oft; whom when his wracks restrain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Impatient of the wrong, impetuously he raves:</div>
  <div class="i0">And in his rageful flow, the furious King of waves</div>
  <div class="i0">Breaks foaming o’er the beach, whom nothing seems to cool,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till he have wrought his will on that capacious pool:</div>
  <div class="i0">Where Menedge, by his brooks, a<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_61" id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span> chersonese is cast,</div>
  <div class="i0">Widening the slender shore to ease it in the waste;</div>
  <div class="i0">A promont jutting out into the dropping south,</div>
  <div class="i0">That with his threatning cliffs in horrid Neptune’s mouth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Derides him and his pow’r: nor cares how him he greets.</div>
  <div class="i0">Next Roseland (as his friend, the mightier Menedge) meets</div>
  <div class="i0">Great Neptune when he swells, and rageth at the rocks</div>
  <div class="i0">(Set out into those seas) inforcing through his shocks</div>
  <div class="i0">Those arms of sea that thrust into the tinny strand,</div>
  <div class="i0">By their meandred creeks indenting of that land,</div>

<p>Near Camel about Camblan, was<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_72" id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span> Arthur slain by Mordred,
and on the same shore, east from the river’s mouth, born in
Tintagel castle. Gorlois Prince of Cornwal, at Uther-Pendragon’s
coronation, solemnized in London, upon divers too
kind passages and lascivious regards twixt the King and his
wife Igerne, grew very jealous, in a rage left the court, committed
his wife’s chastity to this castle’s safeguard; and to prevent
the wasting of his country, (which upon this discontent
was threatned) betook himself in other forts to martial preparation.
Uther (his blood boiling in lust) upon advice of Ulfin
Rhicaradoch, one of his Knights, by Ambrose Merlin’s magic
personated like Gorlois, and Ulfin like one Jordan, servant to
Gorlois, made such successful use of their imposture, that (the
Prince in the mean time slain) Arthur was the same night begotten,
and verified that<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_73" id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span> Νόθοι τε πολλοὶ γνησίων ἀμείνονες.

justified that he was conceived three hours after Gorlois’ death;
by this shift answering the dangerous imputation of bastardy to
the heir of a crown. For Uther taking Igern to wife, left
Arthur his successor in the Kingdom. Here have you a
Jupiter, an Alcmena, an Amphitryo, a Sosias, and a Mercury;
nor wants there scarce any thing, but that truth-passing reports
of Poetical bards have made the birth an Hercules.</p>

Southern, should not be like affected from like cause. I refer
it no more to the Sun, than the special horsemanship in our
Northern men, the nimble ability of the Irish, the fiery motions

that every land hath its so singular self-nature, and individual
habitude with celestial influence, that human knowledge, consisting
most of all in universality, is not yet furnish’d with what
is requisite to so particular discovery. But for the learning of
this point in a special treatise Hippocrates, Ptolemy, Bodin,

the Land’s End, extending itself like a<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_78" id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span> horn, which in most
tongues is Corn, or very near. Thus was a<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_79" id="fnanchor_79"></a><a href="#footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span> promontory in

APPENDIX.<br /><abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2 center">CORNISH NAMES.</p>

<p class="center small">(Communicated by T. Hingston, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> M.D.)</p>

<p class="p2">It is commonly understood, that those places in Cornwall,
which have the word <em>San</em> or <em>Saint</em> as the antecedent
component of their names, are so denominated after some
martyr or confessor of early times. This is a very obvious
and indisputable fact. But it is by no means certain, that
in every instance of the kind, the saint conferred his name
on the place: for in many cases, the converse seems to
have been practised; and contrary to what is generally
imagined, I believe that the place bestowed its name on
the saint. Thus, for example, in <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen</em>, and <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Allan</em>, two saints are equally commemorated; but Stephen,
by his own name, which he possessed independently
of accidental circumstances; and Allan, by a name,
superseding that which he had received at his baptism,
and subsequently derived from the place of his retirement.</p>

<p>The want of this distinction has occasioned unspeakable
labour and perplexity in the investigation of Cornish
antiquities. Books and documents have been examined,
and enquiries made in vain, after names, of which no
record exists; and which, even in their own day, were
scarcely known beyond the narrow district, in which they
were venerated. In some instances, indeed, the objects
of such researches might have been illustrious before their
retirement; but if, in that case, their acts and sufferings
were chronicled, the history was in effect abolished, when
their identity was lost in the assumption of a new name.</p>

<p>Thus many of our early saints took refuge here, from
the persecutions, to which the Christian faith was exposed
<!--319.png--><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pageno">313</span>
in Ireland; and their history has been chiefly sought in
the hagiographies of that country. But the greater number
of them, on coming into Cornwall, complied with this
custom, common, indeed, with all men at that time, of
changing the name with the residence; and accordingly,
instead of that, by which they had been formerly known,
and might have been recorded, they adopted or received
another, as choice or accident determined their settlement.
Hence we have <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hy</em>, or <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Iä</em>, the Island-saint; <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Uny</em>,
(or perhaps more correctly <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Unan</em>) the Down-saint; <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Dennis</em>, the Hill-saint; <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allan</em>, the Moor-saint.</p>

<p>But not only have these, and similar appellations, been
erroneously regarded as the baptismal and proper names
of the saints, whom they commemorate; but the accidental
corruption of some of them has led to still greater
mistakes; and from the mere coincidence of sound, the
saint whose memory was to be preserved, has been identified
with some other person, for whom that honour could
not have been intended. Thus the town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> I’s, or
with the genitive at full length, as it was commonly
written, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ies, has for many generations been called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ives, though the correct form was frequently used till the
close of the seventeenth century. In consequence of this
corruption, the place has been said to have derived its
name from some bishop Ivo, either the Persian, who gave
his name to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, in Huntingdonshire, or the celebrated
Ivo, bishop of Chartres. But <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> I was a female
from Ireland.</p>

<p>The case of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis seems to be of the same kind;
though in that instance the error is not owing to a corruption
of the name, but to the similarity of the sound. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Dennis signifies the <span class="location">Saint on the Hill</span>, or more strictly,
the <span class="location">Hill-saint</span>; and the church stands at this day on the
summit of a hill. But the good man, who lived there, has
been considered the same person as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dionysius, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Dennis, the areopagite.</p>

<p>I cannot help suspecting, that some error of this sort
has occurred in the case of Paul-parish near Penzance,
which is reported to have taken its name from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul de
Leon. Now that portion of the Mount’s bay, by which
this parish is bounded on the east, is called <span class="location">The Lake</span>;
and this lake, which might have been correctly so denominated
in ancient times, is at the foot of the hill, on
which the present church stands; and it is, therefore,
<!--320.png--><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">314</span>
probable that some man of eminent piety once resided
near it. In that case, he was called the <em>Lake-saint</em>, which
rendered into Cornish, becomes <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pol</em>. For this reason,
I believe that the common account is wholly untrue; and
that, as in many other instances, the name of the saint,
and through him, of the parish, originated entirely in a
local accident.</p>

<p>I may state here, that some parishes have a popular
name, arising not unfrequently from very trifling circumstances;
and this name has, in some cases, entirely superseded
the more legitimate denomination, under which the
church was consecrated and registered. Thus, to give one
example, the parish at the Lizard is called <span class="location">Landuwednac</span>,
which signifies the <em>Black-and-white-church</em>. This appellation
was suggested by the peculiar appearance of the
church and tower, which are built of black and white
stones, arranged alternately, in the manner of a chessboard.</p>

<p>Amongst the names of our Cornish towns, there are
three remarkable above the rest for having been very diligently
examined, and very little understood. Upon these
it may be proper to make a few observations.</p>

<p>Of <span class="location">Truro</span> Tonkin says, that ‘it is so called from its three
principal streets; for <dfn>Tri</dfn>, three, and <dfn>Ru</dfn>, a street, have
been turned to <span class="location">Truro</span> merely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">euphoniæ gratia</i>.’ Tonkin
ought to have suspected, that <dfn>Tri</dfn>, occurring as the first
syllable in the name of a town, was not likely to mean
<dfn>three</dfn>, because <dfn>Tri</dfn> or <dfn>Tre</dfn> signifies a dwelling place, or an
assemblage of dwellings, and therefore, a <dfn>town</dfn>. He might
have supposed too, that the place was called <span class="location">Truro</span>, before
its three principal streets were built, or designed; since it
does not appear to have ever had any other name, and we
cannot believe, that it was so denominated by anticipation.
For in those rude times, towns were not commonly laid
out upon a definite plan: but the houses were erected
according to the taste or convenience of the builders; and
the streets seem to have been formed, almost as accident
might determine.</p>

<p>But Whitaker says, that Tonkin’s etymology, which
was adopted from Camden, is altogether absurd; and he
consequently undertakes to find a better. For this purpose
he assumes, that Truro takes its name from its castle.
Now he imagines, that the castle was denominated <span class="location">Trevereu</span>,
and that the name was subsequently familiarized to
<span class="location">Treuro</span>. In that way, he thinks, the etymon at once presents
<!--321.png--><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pageno">315</span>
itself; and we are accordingly informed, that <span class="location">Truro</span>
signifies the castle on the <span class="location">Uro</span>. This, however, is to take
a course the reverse of that pursued by etymologists in
general: for they seek the meaning of a word in its primitive
form, but Mr. Whitaker in its corruption. There is
also another objection, which may be considered equally
conclusive; for, as Mr. Polwhele says, we have no such
river in Cornwall as the <span class="location">Uro</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Polwhele himself has proposed a third explanation,
which, however ingenious, I think equally unsatisfactory.
He suggests, that Truro may be a town of Roman origin;
and that the name is a corruption of <span class="location">Trevorou</span>, the <dfn>town-on-the-ways</dfn>.
But if it were so, we should not be wholly
without any evidence of the fact. Proof would be found
in some obscure tradition, some historical record, or some
local circumstance; and the name itself, upon which alone
this opinion is grounded, would be more completely consistent
with it. When the Romans founded a town, it
was not their custom to give it a name exhibiting no trace
of their own language; but <span class="location">Trúro</span> is unquestionably Cornish;
and besides that, as persons skilled in such matters
would easily see, it is no very natural corruption of <span class="location">Trevórou</span>.
<abbr title="Polwhele History">Polwh. Hist.</abbr> of Cornwall, <abbr title="volume one page">vol. <span class="muchsmaller">I</span>, p.</abbr> 189; <abbr title="volume two page">vol. <span class="muchsmaller">II</span>,
p.</abbr> 215.</p>

<p>Yet that it is a corruption, is certain. In the charter
granted by Reginald Fitzroy, in the reign of Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
the name of the town is written <span class="location">Trivereu</span>. It is of this
word, therefore, that <span class="location">Truro</span> is a corruption; and if we can
determine its signification, we shall ascertain the etymon
of <span class="location">Truro</span>. Now nothing can be better known, than that
<dfn>Rivereu</dfn>, or <dfn>Riverô</dfn>, in the ancient language of this county,
had the same meaning as the kindred word <dfn>rivers</dfn>, in
English: and with regard to the initial <span class="decoration">T</span>, it can be
scarcely necessary to say, that it stands for <dfn>Tre</dfn>, or its
archaic form <dfn>Te</dfn>, a <dfn>town</dfn>. The word, therefore, in the
primitive and proper mode of writing it, is <dfn>Trerivero</dfn>; and
consequently, the name as it appears in Reginald’s charter,
is itself an example of that liability to change, by
which the same word was subsequently converted to
<em>Truro</em>. But the alteration in that case was so slight, that
the composition of the word was scarcely obscured; and
so natural, that its corruption could not have been prevented.
For it was hardly possible in common speech to
avoid the elision, which turns <em>Trerívero</em> into <em>Trívero</em>; as
<!--322.png--><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">316</span>
this again has been contracted to <em>Trúro</em>. The word <em>Truro</em>,
then, signifies the <dfn>Town-on-the-rivers</dfn>, or as we should now
say, <dfn>Riverton</dfn>. And this interpretation is illustrated and
confirmed by the local peculiarities: for the town is intersected
by two rivers, which originally were its boundaries &mdash;the
Cenion on the south, and the Allan on the east.</p>

<p>With respect to <span class="location">Marazion</span> or <span class="location">Marketjew</span>, I need not examine
what has been said about Sion, Jerusalem, and the
Jews; for it is wholly unfounded and absurd. <span class="location">Marghas</span>,
or in its softer form <span class="location">Maras</span>, signifies a <dfn>market</dfn>, and <span class="location">Iän</span>, of
or belonging to an <em>island</em>. Hence <span class="location">Marasían</span> means the
<dfn>Island-market</dfn>. This name is derived from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s
Mount, which is in fact an island; and to its monastery
the market belonged. <span class="location">Marghasjew</span>, as it is called in
Elizabeth’s charter, or as we now speak, <span class="location">Marketjew</span>, signifies
<dfn>Thursday-market</dfn>: the charter, by which the privilege
of a market was granted to the monks by Robert,
earl of Cornwall, having appointed it to be kept on the
<em>fifth</em> day of the week. In Domesday the town is called
<span class="location">Tremarastol</span>, which signifies the <dfn>Market-town-of-the-monastery</dfn>.
These three names, therefore, mutually explain
one another; and their signification is confirmed by the
historical facts.</p>

<p><span class="location">Penzance</span> is said to signify “the <dfn>Saint’s head</dfn>, or rather
the <dfn>Head of the bay</dfn>.” <abbr title="Polwhele History">Polwh. Hist.</abbr> of Cornwall, <abbr title="volume two page">vol. ii.
p.</abbr> 39. I believe that Mr. Polwhele quotes this from
Tonkin. But did Tonkin himself expect that his readers
would be satisfied with an etymology so indeterminate
and contradictory? Yet this is the usual mode of explaining
Cornish words. Camden says, that <span class="location">Penzance</span>, or as
he more correctly spells it, <em>Pensans</em>, means the <dfn>Head of
the sands</dfn>. But Whitaker declares this to be unworthy
of Camden; and he therefore gives us an improved interpretation
of his own. For this purpose he reads Tonkin
backwards; and as that writer renders <em>Pensans</em> the <dfn>Head
of the bay</dfn>, Whitaker asserts it to be the <dfn>Bay of the Head</dfn>!
And this is unworthy of Whitaker. He says, the phrase
is equivalent to <dfn>Mount’s bay</dfn>. But it was never imagined
before, that the Cornish word <em>Pen</em> could signify such an
object as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount; and still less can it be
supposed that a town would be denominated a <dfn>Bay</dfn>. Yet
the real signification of <em>Pensans</em> lay at his feet; for nothing
can be more obvious and easy. The name is derived both
from the little chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, which he himself
<!--323.png--><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pageno">317</span>
describes, and from the point of land, on which that
chapel stood. For there the town took its beginning;
and there, of course, it found a name &mdash;that of the place
which it occupied. Now a <em>point of land</em> was in Cornish
called <dfn>Pen</dfn>; and when it chanced to be distinguished by
the erection of a chapel, it would naturally be denominated
<em>sacred</em> or <em>holy</em>, which was expressed by the word <em>san</em>, or
if it was a terminal syllable, <em>sans</em>. Hence <em>Pensans</em> signifies
<dfn>Holy-head</dfn>; and in allusion to this, John the Baptist’s
head is in the town-arms.</p>

<p>But Mr. Whitaker would not have committed this error,
if he had been heedful of a principle, observed in the
composition of Cornish words, which can never be safely
overlooked, in any attempt to investigate their meaning.
The ancient names of places in Cornwall mostly consist
of two substantive nouns, one of which has the force of
an adjective, and qualifies the other: as <em>Penrose</em>, <em>Penpraze</em>,
<em>Polwhele</em>. The component parts of such words have
always been treated as if they had been associated by
caprice, or accident; and the same elements have been
represented as adjectives or substantives indifferently, according
to the fancy or convenience of the interpreter.</p>

<p>But in truth, the ingredients of all these compounds
are combined and distinguished by a settled rule. It is
generally supposed, that in all instances the word used
substantively precedes that which is employed adjectively.
In many cases, however, it does not: and as, therefore,
the qualifying noun cannot with certainty be discovered
by its position, they who suppose it to occupy uniformly
the second place, can be right only by chance; and we
are consequently to look for some other mark, by which
it may be easily and invariably known. That mark is the
<em>accent</em>. Thus we say <em>Pensáns</em>: and so, if we admit, what
Mr. Whitaker supposes, that <em>Pen</em> may signify a <dfn>hill</dfn>, and
<em>sans</em> a <dfn>bay</dfn>, the word in that case would mean the <dfn>Bay-hill</dfn>,
and not as he says, the <dfn>Hill-bay</dfn>.</p>

<p>But as this accent lives only in common speech, and
the peculiarities of the English manner have already considerably
disturbed it, those who have occasion to write
any Cornish words, and especially the cultivators of our
history and antiquities, should always mark the accented
syllable: for there is no other way of making this rule of
interpretation available; and of preventing perplexities
for the time to come, still greater than those, which have
<!--324.png--><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">318</span>
already existed. But besides the natural and inevitable
tendency of the predominant English to change the pronunciation
of Cornish words, there is a kind of whim or
fashion amongst some, who know nothing of these things,
by which the corruption is wilfully hastened; and while
they confidently say <em>Pénrose</em>, <em>Pénprase</em>, and <em>Nánkivel</em>, they
presume to correct those, who with more knowledge or
less affectation, are accustomed to speak otherwise.</p>

observable, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> “That in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petroc’s
church at Bodmin were first
monks, then nuns, then Secular
priests, then monks again, then
canons; the last foundation was
by Will. Warlewast bishop of
Exon.” Mr. Speed further adds,
that after the canons were Grey
friers (but these last were in a distinct
house of their own in this
town; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide infra</i>) he also tells us of
a priory of Black canons founded by
<abbr title="King">K.</abbr> Ethelstan to the honour of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Petrorsi at Bonury in this county,
which in all probability was the

 That Talcarn is the same with
Minstre appears from the registers
of the bishops of Exeter; where in
the register of Bishop Branscomb,
<abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 27. b. mention is made of “Talthar
or Talcarne a cell to Tywardreth;”
and in Bishop Stapeldon’s
register, <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 82. b. it is stiled “ecclesia
de la Minstre alias de Talcarne.”
Gervase of Canterbury,
among other Cornish monasteries in
his time, reckons Talcarn and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mary de Valle as cells of Black
monks to Algiers, but I know not
where the latter was situated, unless
it was the same with <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Michael de
Valle a priory in Guernsey. Mr.
Burton and Mr. Speed have also
these two houses, but they mistook
the reading in the <abbr title="manuscript">ms.</abbr> of Gervase
of Cant. who, in the column of the
orders, hath, against these two and
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony “mon. n. de Angs,”
which they translated “Black monks
of the Angells,” an order nowhere
else to be met with. Black monks
of Angiers seems most probable, and
that they were cells to that foreign
abbey, as Tywardreth certainly was,
on which Talcarn appears to have
been dependent.</p>

and dyvers injuncions commandyng me straytle to see
obseruyd and kept; which ar noo harder than our owne
rule and profession byndis us, and as alle other relygyus
men use and observe where gode relygion is observed and

most parte of them to depart with capacitise, with owt my
concent and wylle, and won of them hathe purchased a capacyte

for the yl example to other; for yf I should suffer this
man to depart yn thys manner I shal have never a chanon

Roger Arundell a gret berar and mayntynar of my bretherne

for that I have not suffered this lewde chanon to depart

APPENDIX.<br /><abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr></h3>

<p class="p2 center">EARLS OF CORNWALL.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> following account of the different individuals who
have held the office of Prince or Earl of Cornwall from
the earliest times, till the period of its becoming merely
nominal, excepting as to emolument and patronage, with
the new appellation of Duke, under the fantastic settlement
of King Edward the Third, is derived from Dugdale’s
Baronage.</p>

<p class="p2 center">EARLS OF CORNWALL ANTE CONQU:</p>

<p>Anno 499. Of this county was Gorlois Earl, in the
time of Uther Pendragon, King of the Britons, of whom
this is reported.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_182" id="fnanchor_182"></a><a href="#footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span> That Uther determining to solemnize
the Feast of Easter at London, with great honor, appointed
all his nobles to be thereat, amongst which, this
Gorlois then was, together with Igerna his wife, whose
beauty did surpass all other British women, so that the
king fell in love with her, and courted her with all delicates;
which being discerned by the Earl, he retired
speedily into his country without leave; the king, therefore,
being highly incensed against him for so doing,
hasted after him into Cornwall, and fired divers of his
towns, and at length besieged him at Dimilioch, provoked
him to come out to battle, which he did so inconsiderately,
<!--353.png--><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pageno">347</span>
he being one of the first mortally wounded, his followers
disperst themselves. After whose death the king took
Igerna to wife, and begot on her a son, called Arthur, who
became afterwards not a little famous.</p>

<p>Anno 517. The next Earl was Cador,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_183" id="fnanchor_183"></a><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span> who when
King Arthur had besieged Colgrine, the Saxon General in
the City of York, understanding that Baldulph the
brother of Colgrine, expecting the coming of more Saxons
upon the sea coast, designed to fall upon King Arthur in
the night time, Arthur having notice thereof by his
scouts, sent this valiant Cador with six hundred horse,
and three thousand foot, who, meeting the enemy unexpectedly,
slew many of them, and routed the rest.</p>

<p>Anno 520. About three years after,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span> upon another
invasion of the Saxons, and a great battle fought with
them near Bathe in Somersetshire, wherein Colgrine and
Baldulph (before mentioned) lost their lives; and Cheldric
the other principal leader of them, with the remaining
part of their forces, were put to flight, this Earl Cador,
by King Arthur’s command, pursued them into the Isle
of Thanet, slew Cheldric, and forced the rest to yield
themselves to his mercy.</p>

<p>Anno 542. This noble Cador left issue Constantine,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span>
whom King Arthur at his death appointed to be his successor
in his kingdom of Britain.</p>

<p>The next Earl was Godric,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_184" id="fnanchor_184"></a><a href="#footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></span> of whom I have seen no
other mention than that Egelwold, sometime King of
England, leaving no other issue that survived him, but
one daughter, named Goldusburgh, (six years of age at
his death) committed her to the tuition of this Godric,
who afterwards gave her in marriage to Haveloc, son to
Birkelan King of Denmark.</p>

<p>In the time of King Æthelred, Ailmer, or Æthelmare,
(for so he was also called) was Earl of this county, who
being a person of singular piety, founded<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_185" id="fnanchor_185"></a><a href="#footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span> first of all the
Abbey of Cerne in Dorsetshire, in the days of King Edgar,
and had so great a veneration to the memory of
Eadwan, brother of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund the Martyr, who led<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span> an
hermit’s life in Dorsetshire,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_186" id="fnanchor_186"></a><a href="#footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></span> before mentioned, near to a
certain spring called the Silver Well, that with the help of
Dunstan (Archbishop of Canterbury) he translated his
<!--354.png--><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a><span class="pageno">348</span>
relics to the old church of Cernel, then the parish
church.</p>

<p>After this, scil. in <abbr title="Anno">An.</abbr> 1005 (in the time of King Ethelred,)
he founded<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_187" id="fnanchor_187"></a><a href="#footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></span> the Abbey of Eynesham in Oxfordshire,
and likewise<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_188" id="fnanchor_188"></a><a href="#footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></span> the Priory of Bruton in Somersetshire, (all
Monks of the Benedictine Order) which he amply endowed,
as by the authorities which I have here cited will
appear; though in that of Bruton, canons of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine
were afterwards placed.</p>

<p>This Ailmer was<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_189" id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span> also Earl of Devonshire, under which
title, in the year 1013, when<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span> Suane, King of Denmark,
overrun the greatest part of the land with his army, and
forced King Ethelred to betake himself unto the city of
Winchester for refuge, he with all the great men of the
West, fearing the tyranny of the Danes, submitted<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span> themselves
to Suane, and gave hostages<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span> for their peaceable
obedience unto him. And about three years after this,
when King Edmond Ironside fought so stoutly against
King Canute, (son to the same Suane) he joining<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_190" id="fnanchor_190"></a><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span> with
that traitorous Eadric Streone, Earl of Mercia, and Earl
Algar, adhered<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span> to Canute.</p>

<p>Of his issue there nothing more appeareth, than that
he left a son<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_191" id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span> called Æthelward, who in the year 1018
was killed<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span> by King Canute, together with that great
traitor Eadric Streone, Earl of Mercia.</p>

<p class="p2 center">ROBERT, EARL OF CORNWALL.</p>

<p>To this Earldom was Robert, Earl<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_192" id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span> of Moreton in
Normandy,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span> brother to King William by the mother,
shortly<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span> after the Conquest advanced, and had other great
honours given<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span> him in this realm.</p>

<p>In the time of King William Rufus, taking<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_193" id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></span> part with
his brother Odo, Earl of Kent, in that insurrection on
the behalf of Robert Curthose, he held<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_194" id="fnanchor_194"></a><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span> the castle of
Pevensey on that account; but so soon as the King laid
siege thereto, rendered<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span> it up to him, and made his peace.</p>

<p>This Earl having had<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_195" id="fnanchor_195"></a><a href="#footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></span> the standard of Saint Michael
<!--355.png--><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pageno">349</span>
carried before him in battle, as the words of his charter
do import (under which it is to be presumed he had been
prosperous) did, out of great devotion to God and the
Blessed Virgin, for the health of his soul and the soul of
his wife, as also for the soul of the most glorious King
William (for those are his expressions) give<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_196" id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span> the Monastery
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Michael, at the Mount in Cornwall, unto the
Monks of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Michael de Periculo Maris in Normandy,
and to their successors in pure alms.</p>

<p>To the Abbey of Grestein in Normandy<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_197" id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span> founded by
Herlwine de Contevill, his father, he was a great benefactor,
for he gave<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_198" id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span> thereunto the lordships of Gratings and
Broteham in Suffolk, and the tithe of Cambis, as also his
lands at Saisinton in Cambridgeshire; which place of
Gratings (now Cretings) was a cell to that foreign monastery.
He likewise<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span> gave thereto the manor of Wilminton
in Sussex, where also there was a cell for monks
of that religious house; and in Ferlis<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span> five hides of lands.
In Pevensel he gave<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span> them the house of one Engeler; and
in his Forest of Pevensel, granted to them pannage and
herbage, with timber for repair of their churches and
houses, as also fuel for fire.</p>

<p>He gave moreover to that Abbey of Grestein half the
fishing of Langeney, and the whole tithe of that fishing,
as also the churches of Eldene, Wesdene, and Ferles, and
one hide of land at Heetone. But whereas he found that
the greatest part of the possessions which belonged to the
Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petroc at Bodmin in Cornwall, founded by
King Æthelstan, had been<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_199" id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span> taken from the same, and
enjoyed by canons secular, he therefore seised<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span> upon the
remainder, and converted them to his own use.</p>

<p>When he departed this world, I do not find; but if he
lived after William Rufus so fatally lost his life by the
glance of an arrow in New Forest from the bow of Walter
Tirell; then was it unto him that this strange apparition
happened, which I shall here speak of, otherwise it must
be to his son and successor Earl William,&mdash;the story<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_200" id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span>
whereof is as followeth. In that very hour that the king
received that fatal stroke, the Earl of Cornwall being hunting
in a wood distant from that place about two &mdash;&mdash;
<!--356.png--><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pageno">350</span>
and left alone by his attendants, was accidentally met by
a very great black goat, bearing the king all black, and
naked, and wounded through the midst of his breast; and
adjuring the goat by the Holy Trinity to tell what that
was he so carried, he answered, “I am carrying your King
to judgment, yea that tyrant William Rufus, for I am an
evil spirit, and the revenger of his malice which he bore to
the church of God, and it was I that did cause this his
slaughter; the protomartyr of England, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban, commanding
me so to do; who complained to God of him for
his grievous oppressions in this Isle of Britain, which he
first hallowed,” all which the Earl related soon after to his
followers.</p>

<p>This Earl Robert took to wife<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_201" id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span> Maud, daughter to
Roger de Montgomery (Earl of Shrewsbury) which Maud
was also a great benefactress to the Monks of Grestine in
Normandy, by the gift<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_202" id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span> of Conoc, consisting of ten hides,
and two hides in Bodingham, with the church of that place,
as also one house in London, with all customs thereto belonging.
Moreover, she gave<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span> unto them two and thirty
hides of land which she had of Roger de Montgomery her
father, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> at Harinton eight, at Mersen eleven, at Hiteford
six, at Langeberge two, at Tavistone three and an half, and
at Clavendon three yards land.</p>

<p>By this Maud he had issue<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_203" id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span> <span class="sc">William</span>, who succeeded
him in these earldoms of Moreton and Cornwall, and
three daughters, whose Christian names are not expressed;
whereof the first was wife<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span> to Andrew de Vitrei; the Second
to<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span> Guy de la Val; the third to the Earl of Thoulouse,
brother to Raymond Count of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles, who
behaved himself so valiantly in the Jerusalem expedition.</p>

<p>The lands whereof he was possessed at the time of the
Conqueror’s Survey,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_204" id="fnanchor_204"></a><a href="#footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></span> were in Sussex, fifty-four manors,
besides the borough of Pevensel; in Devonshire seventy-five,
besides a church and a house in Exeter; in Yorkshire
an hundred and ninety-six; in Wiltshire five; in
Dorsetshire forty-nine; in Suffolk ten; in Hantshire one;
in Middlesex five; in Oxfordshire one; in Cambridgeshire
five; in Hertfordshire thirteen; in Buckinghamshire
twenty-nine; in Gloucestershire one; in Northamptonshire
<!--357.png--><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span class="pageno">351</span>
ninety-nine; in Nottinghamshire six; and in
Cornwall two hundred and forty-eight, having two castles,
one at Dunhevet, the other at Tremeton.</p>

<p>William, succeeding Earl Robert his father in the
earldom of Moreton in Normandy, and this of Cornwall,
being a person<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_205" id="fnanchor_205"></a><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span> of a malicious and arrogant spirit from
his childhood, envied the glory of King Henry the First;
and not contented with those two earldoms, demanded
from King Henry the earldom of Kent as his right, which
earldom his uncle Odo (the Bishop) formerly had, giving
out<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span> privately, that he would not put on his robe, unless
that inheritance which he challenged by descent from his
uncle might be restored to him, unto which demand, the
King at first, considering<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span> his own unsettled condition,
gave<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span> a subtile and dilatory answer; but when<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span> he discerned
that those clouds, from whence he doubted a storm,
were over, he not only denied<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span> his request, but began to
question him for whatsoever he possessed unrightfully;
yet (that he might not seem to oppose what was just)
modestly yielding<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span> that he should have a lawful trial for
the same; but with that judicial sentence, which thereupon
ensued, this Earl being highly displeased, in a great
rage got over into Normandy, and there besides some
fruitless attempts which he made against the King’s castles,
having an evil eye towards Richard Earl of Chester (son
of Hugh) made<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_206" id="fnanchor_206"></a><a href="#footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span> no little spoil upon his lands, though he
was then but a child, and in the King’s tutelage; from
which time, together with Robert de Bellesme, Earl of
Shrewsbury, he ceased not<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span> to foment a rebellion in those
parts. Anno 1103.</p>

<p>4th <abbr title="Henry First">H. I.</abbr> 1104. The king therefore discerning these his
practises, seised<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_207" id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></span> upon all his possessions here in England,
razed<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_208" id="fnanchor_208"></a><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span> his castles to the ground, and banished<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span> him this
realm.</p>

<p>And not long after passing<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span> over into Normandy to
quench those flames which these two earls had made by
joining with Robert Curthose (who thought himself injured,
that his younger brother Henry had made himself King,)
subdued<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span> (anno 1106) all that power which there appeared
against him, and at length laid siege to Tenerchebray (a
town belonging to this<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span> Earl). For the raising whereof
<!--358.png--><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a><span class="pageno">352</span>
Duke Robert with this William, and Robert de Belesme,
and many other came<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_209" id="fnanchor_209"></a><a href="#footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></span> with a great army, where a short
fight<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_210" id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></span> ensued, this earl leading<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_211" id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span> the van, and Robert de
Belesme the rear; and of the king’s army, Ranulf de
Bajorsis (an eminent baron) the van, and Robert Earl of
Mellent the rear. The armies thus disposed, our Earl
William made the<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_212" id="fnanchor_212"></a><a href="#footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></span> onset upon Ranulf with extraordinary
courage, but could not break through his troops, they
stood so stoutly to it. The front on both sides thus maintaining
their ground, Helias Earl of Maine, (on the
King’s part) fell upon the flank of the enemy’s foot, who
being not well armed, were soon shattered, which disorder,
being observed by Robert de Bellesme, he began
to fly with the rear; whereupon, the King soon obtained
an absolute victory, the duke himself being made prisoner,
and all his principal adherents, amongst which, this Earl,
being taken by the Britains, from whose hands the king
and his friends had much ado to get him, was sent prisoner
into England, there to be secured during his life.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_213" id="fnanchor_213"></a><a href="#footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></span>
After which, the king causing his eyes to be put out,
bestowed<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_214" id="fnanchor_214"></a><a href="#footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></span> his earldom of Moreton upon Stephen of Blois
(son of Stephen Earl of Champaine), whom he then
honoured with knighthood, who was after King of England.</p>

<p>This Earl William built<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_215" id="fnanchor_215"></a><a href="#footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></span> the castle of Montacute in
Somersetshire, and called it by that name from the sharpness
of the hill on which he did set it, and likewise
founded<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_216" id="fnanchor_216"></a><a href="#footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></span> a priory near thereto, which he amply endowed,
annexing it as a cell to the Abbey of Cluny in Burgundy.</p>

<p>He also gave<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_217" id="fnanchor_217"></a><a href="#footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></span> to the Abbey of Bee in Normandy his
lordship of Preston in the Rape of Pevensel in Sussex,
and was buried<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_218" id="fnanchor_218"></a><a href="#footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></span> in the Abbey of Bermondsey in Southwark;
but when he died, I find no mention, nor of either
wife or issue that he had.</p>

REGINALD EARL OF CORNWALL.</p>

<p>This Reginald was<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_219" id="fnanchor_219"></a><a href="#footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></span> one of the illegitimate sons of King
Henry the First, (begotten, as it is generally believed,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_220" id="fnanchor_220"></a><a href="#footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></span> on
the daughter of Robert Corbet,) and surnamed<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_221" id="fnanchor_221"></a><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span> de Dunstanvill.</p>

<p>In 3 Stephen, he was a stout adherer<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span> to Maud the
Empress, against Stephen; but afterwards falling off, was
in anno 1140 (5 <abbr title="Stephen">Steph.</abbr>) made<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_222" id="fnanchor_222"></a><a href="#footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></span> Earl of Cornwall by that
king. Howbeit, after this, being surprised in Cornwall,
at a certain castle then in the power of the king, by one
William Fitz Richard (a person of a noble extraction and
ample fortune in those parts) violating his faith to that
king, he married the daughter of this William,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_223" id="fnanchor_223"></a><a href="#footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></span> and
thereupon reduced that whole country to his will, grievously
oppressing all the king’s party, and not sparing
what was sacred, insomuch as he underwent the sentence
of ex-communication for so doing by the Bishop of Exeter.
The king therefore hearing of these his rebellious
practices, marched suddenly thither with a powerful
army, and recovering those strong-holds by him gained,
committed<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_224" id="fnanchor_224"></a><a href="#footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></span> them to the trust of Earl Alan (of Richmond).</p>

<p>After this, scil. in 6 <abbr title="Stephen">Steph.</abbr> he was<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_225" id="fnanchor_225"></a><a href="#footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span> in that fatal battle
of Lincoln, against King Stephen; but ere long, the tide
turning, by the success which the king had in taking<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_226" id="fnanchor_226"></a><a href="#footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></span> the
Castle of Forandune, in <abbr title="comitatus">com.</abbr> Berks, which Robert Earl
of Gloucester had built on the behalf of the empress,
being by her sent with overtures of peace to the king, he
was taken by Philip, a younger son to that earl, who
had revolted to the king’s side.</p>

<p>After which time I find no more mention of him till
2 Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> that he had the lordship of Meleburne, in
<abbr title="comitatus">com.</abbr> Somerset, given<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_228" id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></span> him by King Henry, as also<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_229" id="fnanchor_229"></a><a href="#footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></span> the
manors of Karswill and Depeford, with the hundreds.</p>

<p>In 10 Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> he endeavoured (for the king’s honour
as it is said) a reconciliation betwixt King Henry and
<!--360.png--><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a><span class="pageno">354</span>
Thomas Becket, then Archbishop of Canterbury; which
not taking effect, he was the next year sent<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_231" id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></span> to visit him
in his sickness, and after that to<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_232" id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span> acquaint him with the
judgment given against him.</p>

<p>Furthermore, upon the levying of that aid, in 12 Henry
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> for marrying the king’s daughter, he certified<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_233" id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></span> his
knights’ fees to be two hundred and fifteen and a third
part in Cornwall and Devonshire; for which, in 14 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
he paid<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_234" id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span> two hundred and fifteen marks, 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 5<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> besides<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span>
£59. 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> for the knights’ fees of Richard (de Redvers)
Earl of Devon.</p>

<p>Moreover, in 19 Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> upon that rebellion of Robert
Earl of Leicester, on the behalf of young Henry (the
king’s son), he marched<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_235" id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span> against him (with the Earl of
Gloucester) to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edmondsbury, and the year following
joined with<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_236" id="fnanchor_236"></a><a href="#footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span> Richard de Luci (at that time Justice of
England) in the siege of Leicester, then held out by the
forces of the earl, which town they took,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span> though not the
castle.</p>

<p>This Earl Reginald, for the health of the soul of King
Henry his father, gave<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_237" id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></span> to the monks in the Isle of
Sully, all the wreck of sea happening upon that island,
excepting Wales, and any whole ship. And departing<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_238" id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span>
this life at Certesey in anno 1175 (21 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>) was buried<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span>
at Reading, having issue four daughters, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> &mdash;&mdash;
married<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_239" id="fnanchor_239"></a><a href="#footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></span> to Richard de Redvers, Lord of the Isle of

Walter de Dunstanvill; and Sarah, to<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_241" id="fnanchor_241"></a><a href="#footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></span> the Viscount of
Limoges, who had,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></span> in frank marriage with her, the moiety
of the manor of Thiwernhy in Cornwall.</p>

<p>He also left issue<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_242" id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span> two sons, but illegitimate; the one
called<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span> Henry FitzCount, begotten<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span> on the body of Beatrix
de Vaus, lady of Torre and Karswell; which Henry,
through the bounty of King Henry the Second, had a
grant<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span> of the whole county of Cornwall, as also of<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span> the

<p><!--361.png--><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pageno">355</span>
Upon the death of this Reginald, the king retained<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_243" id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span> the
Earldom of Cornwall in his own hands, and likewise all
his lands in England and Wales, for the use of John his
own son (afterwards king), excepting<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span> a small proportion
to his daughters before mentioned.</p>

<p class="p2">I come now to Henry (the older of his illegitimate sons)
in regard he was a person of note in his time.</p>

<p>This Henry, by the name<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_244" id="fnanchor_244"></a><a href="#footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></span> of Henry <span class="sc">Fitz-Count</span>, had

for his support in that king’s service at Roan; and about
that time gave<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_245" id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span> twelve hundred marks for the lands of
William de Traci, which lands Hugh de Curtenai and
Henry de Traci afterwards enjoyed.</p>

<p>In 17 <abbr title="John">Joh.</abbr> this Henry had from the king a grant<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_246" id="fnanchor_246"></a><a href="#footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></span> of
the whole county of Cornwall, with the demesnes, and all
other its appurtenances, to farm, until the Realm should
be in peace, and the king clearly satisfied whether he
ought to hold it by right of inheritance, or as part of the
demesne of the crown; and being then made constable<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_247" id="fnanchor_247"></a><a href="#footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span>
of the castle at Lanceston, rendered<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span> up the government
of the castle of Porcestre, which he had formerly held.
Moreover, by the assent<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_248" id="fnanchor_248"></a><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span> of that king, he held<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span> the town
and castle of Totneis, as also<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span> the manors of Corneworth
and Lodeswell, which Reginald de Braose formerly had by
the grant of King Henry the Second. And 1 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
obtained another grant<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_249" id="fnanchor_249"></a><a href="#footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></span> of the county of Cornwall, with
all its appurtenances, to hold in as full and ample manner
as Reginald Earl of Cornwall held it, and not to be disseised
thereof, but by judgment of the King’s Court.</p>

<p>In 4 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> it appears<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_250" id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span> that he stood indebted to
the king in five hundred ninety-seven pounds and one
mark, which was due by him to King John for the honour
of Braeles (alias Broeneis), and that the same year disobeying<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_251" id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
the king’s commands, as also stubbornly departing<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
the court without leave, the king discharged all his
subjects,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span> and in particular those of Cornwall, from having
anything to do with him. Howbeit, soon after, through
the mediation<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span> of the Bishops of Norwich, Winchester,
and Exeter, as also<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span> of Hubert de Burgh (then Justice of
<!--362.png--><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pageno">356</span>
England) and some others, giving<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_252" id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span> up the Castle of Lanceston,
and the county of Cornwall, with all the homage
and services thereto belonging, as fully as King John
enjoyed them at the beginning of the war which he had
with his barons, his peace<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span> was then made with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salvo
jure</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> saving the right he pretended to for that county,
wherein the king was to do him justice when he should
come of age.</p>

<p>But that as it seems was never done: for certain it is
that the king did not arrive to his full age till long after
the death of this Henry, it being evident<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_253" id="fnanchor_253"></a><a href="#footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></span> that he died
about two years after, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in 6 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> whereupon
command was given to the Sheriff of Cornwall, that he
should permit his executors to enjoy all his goods, and
likewise the rents of all his lands whereof he was possessed
when he went to Hierusalem for the full term, for
all those who were signed with the cross.</p>

<p>It is by some thought that this Henry succeeded his
father in the Earldom of Cornwall, in regard that King
Henry the Third in the first year of his reign granted to
him the county of Cornwall, with all its appurtenances, as
is above expressed. But considering that the title of earl
was never attributed to him after that time, I cannot
conceive anything more passed by that grant, than the
barony or revenue of that county. For it is observable,
that in patent<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_254" id="fnanchor_254"></a><a href="#footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></span> to Richard Duke of Gloucester, by King
Edward the Fourth, whereby he grants him Castrum,
Comitatum, Honorem, et Dominium Richmundiæ, there
passed no more than the mere Seignorie, otherwise he
would not have omitted the title of Earl thereof amongst
his styles. The like may be noted of Raphe Earl of Westmerland,
who had Castrum, Comitatum, Dominium, et
Honorem Richmundiæ granted<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_255" id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></span> to him by King Henry the
Fourth, yet never enjoyed the title of Earl of Richmond.</p>

<p class="p2 center">RICHARD EARL OF CORNWALL.</p>

<p>Of this county, Richard, a younger son to King John
(for he calls him<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_256" id="fnanchor_256"></a><a href="#footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></span> filius noster) had the title of Earl in the
<!--363.png--><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span class="pageno">357</span>
time of King Henry the Third. Of him the first mention
I find is in 16 <abbr title="John">Joh.</abbr> the king then directing his precept<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_257" id="fnanchor_257"></a><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span>
to Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of Winchester, (at that time
Justice of England) for livery (though then very young)
of all the lands of Roese de Dovor, whom he had married,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span>
she being in the custody<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span> of William de Brewer; but not
long after this (notwithstanding his tender years) he was,
in 1 <abbr title="Henry Three">H. III.</abbr> constituted governor<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_258" id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></span> of Chileham Castle in
Kent, and the next ensuing year obtained a grant<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_259" id="fnanchor_259"></a><a href="#footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></span> from
the king of the honour of Walingford.</p>

<p>Moreover, in 5 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> he had a grant<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_260" id="fnanchor_260"></a><a href="#footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></span> of the honour
of Eye, to hold during pleasure, (which shortly after was
rendered to the Duke of Lovain, the right owner thereof);
and in 9 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> had the like grant<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_261" id="fnanchor_261"></a><a href="#footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></span> of the custody of
the county of Cornwall (<span class="decoration">id est</span> the sherevalty) during the
king’s pleasure, Henry de Berkering being his substitute.</p>

<p>In this 9th year of Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> he was girt<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_262" id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></span> with the
sword of knighthood, upon Candlemas Day, with ten
other noble persons who were designed for his service;
and soon after accompanied<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_263" id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span> William Longespe, Earl of
Salisbury, (his uncle,) into Gascoigne, having letters of<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span>
recommendation from the King to the Archbishop and
Citizens of Burdeaux, who gladly welcoming him thither,
assisted<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span> him with their best advice for recovery of those
lost territories; whereupon he raised<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_264" id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span> forces in all those
parts, having had from the king (before he set out of
England) a grant of the county of Cornwall, with all
Poictou, for which respect he was generally called<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span> Earl of
Poictou; and marching into the country, in a short time
subjugated<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span> all those places by force which declined to
do homage to him, receiving a supply<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_265" id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span> of Welsh from
hence, with a large<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span> sum of money.</p>

<p>It is reported,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_266" id="fnanchor_266"></a><a href="#footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></span> that whilst he lay at the siege of the
castle of Riole, hearing of the approach of the Earl of
March, he divided his army, and with part thereof, keeping
the seige with the rest, gave him battle, and obtained an
absolute victory, whereby he gained all their baggage, and
took many prisoners; and not long after this, having
merited so well by these his successful beginnings, upon
the third day of Pentecost (id est, 3 calend. Junii,
<!--364.png--><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pageno">358</span>
11 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) was advanced to<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_267" id="fnanchor_267"></a><a href="#footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></span> the title and dignity of
Earl of Cornwall, at Westminster, with great solemnity.</p>

<p>But within a while after there grew much difference<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_268" id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span>
betwixt him and the king his brother, touching a certain
lordship given to Waleran Teutonicus (id est, Ties) by
King John, which he alleged<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span> to be parcel of the Earldom
of Cornwall, and caused possession to be taken of it for
himself; whereupon, Waleran making a complaint, the king
first wrote to him about it, and then sent for him, commanding
the render thereof, which he refused to do,
challenging the judgment of his peers as to matter of
right. Whereat the king took such offence that he
required him forthwith to do it, or depart the realm;
unto which he answered, that he would not deliver up
the land, nor, without the sentence of his peers, go out of
the kingdom; and in great discontent departing went<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span> to
his own house; which breach betwixt the king and him
caused Hubert de Burgh (then justice of England, and in
chief power at court) to advise the king to surprise him
in his bed the next night following, lest he should raise a
disturbance in the realm; but being privily advertised
of that design, he fled immediately away, making no stop
till he got<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_269" id="fnanchor_269"></a><a href="#footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></span> to Reading; and thence hasting to Marlborough,
there found his trusty friend William Mareschal,
Earl of Pembroke, unto whom having made relation of
what had passed, they took their course to the Earl of
Chester; and being thus got together, through the power
and interest of their friends raised a potent army, making
their rendezvous at Stanford, whence they sent a
minatory message to the king, but imputing all the fault
to Hubert de Burgh, requiring a confirmation of that
charter of the forest which had been cancelled at Oxford.
The king, therefore, discerning this cloud, appointed a
meeting at Northampton upon the third of the nones of
August next following, assuring them that he would there
do full right unto all; where meeting accordingly, for
their better satisfaction (amongst other his condescensions)
he gave this Earl Richard his mother’s dowry, with all the
lands in England which did appertain to the Earl of Britanny,
as also those which belonged to the Earl of Bolein,
then deceased<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_270" id="fnanchor_270"></a><a href="#footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></span>; whereupon, he had livery<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_271" id="fnanchor_271"></a><a href="#footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></span> of the whole
<!--365.png--><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span class="pageno">359</span>
county of Rutland. And in 15 Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> obtained another
grant<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_272" id="fnanchor_272"></a><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span> of the inheritance of the honour of Walingford,
with the castle and all its appurtenances, as also the
manor of Watlington, to hold by the service of three
knights’ fees; likewise, of all the lands in England<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span> which
Queen Isabell (the king’s mother) held in dower, and of
those which belonged to Robert de Drewes, and to the
Duke of Lorrain (at that time seised into the king’s hands),
to hold until such time as the king should restore them.</p>

<p>Moreover, he then procured another grant<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span> of the
whole county of Cornwall, with the stanneries and mines,
to be held of the king and his heirs by the service of two
knights’ fees, bearing at that time the title<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span> of Earl of
Cornwall and Poictou. And before the end of that year,
(<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in the month of April,) the solemnity of the Feast of
Easter being finished, took<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_273" id="fnanchor_273"></a><a href="#footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></span> to wife Isabell, Countess of
Gloucester, widow of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester,
and sister to William Mareschal, then Earl of Pembroke;
likewise the same year he obtained a grant<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_274" id="fnanchor_274"></a><a href="#footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></span> of the manor,
castle, and honour of Knaresburgh, in <abbr title="comitatus">com.</abbr> Ebor. to himself
and the issue of his body by the same Isabell, to hold
by the service of two knights’ fees.</p>

<p>Nor was he less eminent for his military knowledge
than for those his great advancements in riches and
honour; for in 20 Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> ambassadors from the
Emperor came<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_275" id="fnanchor_275"></a><a href="#footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></span> to the king to desire that he might be
sent to make war on his behalf against the French; but
the king (though then married) having no child, answered,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></span>
that it could not stand with reason or safety that a person
so young, and especially at that time being the heir apparent
to the crown, should be employed on such an hazardous
adventure, offering them the choice of any other.
Nevertheless, before<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_276" id="fnanchor_276"></a><a href="#footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></span> the end of that year, this earl (with
Gilbert Marshal, then Earl of Pembroke, and divers other
great men) took<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></span> upon him the cross for a journey to the
Holy Land; and for the better furnishing himself with
money, sold many of his woods; but notwithstanding this
resolution, he went not at that time, for the next year
following, (<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 21 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) the king being seduced by
the advice of aliens, and having wasted his treasure,
required<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_277" id="fnanchor_277"></a><a href="#footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></span> a great supply from his subjects, which being
<!--366.png--><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pageno">360</span>
granted and put into the hands of aliens to be transported,
occasioned<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_278" id="fnanchor_278"></a><a href="#footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></span> high discontents; this earl, therefore,
dealt freely with him, and represented to him the danger
thereof; and though he found that what he then said
availed little, ceased not the next year following to continue<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></span>
his good advice, and in particular to tell him how
ill he had done in permitting Simon de Montfort to marry
the Countess of Pembroke his sister; which free and
plain dealing with the king did not at all alienate his
affections from him, for shortly after, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in 23 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
he obtained a grant<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_279" id="fnanchor_279"></a><a href="#footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></span> of the Castle of Lidford and Forest
of Dertmore in fee; before the end of which year, meeting<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_280" id="fnanchor_280"></a><a href="#footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></span>
with divers of the nobility at Northampton, they did there
by oath oblige<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></span> themselves to go forthwith into the Holy
Land for the service of God and the church.</p>

<p>Taking his leave therefore (soon after) of the bishops
and divers others of the nobles at Reading, (there met by
the appointment of the Pope’s Legate,) many of them
wept,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_281" id="fnanchor_281"></a><a href="#footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></span> in regard he was a person wholly minding the public
welfare; whereupon, he told<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_282" id="fnanchor_282"></a><a href="#footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></span> them, that had he not
made his vow, he would go rather than stay to see the
approaching miseries fall upon this realm; and having
prepared<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_283" id="fnanchor_283"></a><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span> all things ready for his journey, came<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span> to the
Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban’s, where, in full chapter, he desired<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span>
the prayers of that whole convent for his good success, then
went<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span> to London, and took his leave<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span> of the king, the
legate, and nobles, and so hasted to Dovor; whence, soon
after arriving in France, he was nobly received<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_284" id="fnanchor_284"></a><a href="#footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></span> by the
king of that realm, and his mother, who sent<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></span> the marshall
to conduct him through that country, and to entertain
him in all places honourably thence to Avinion,
where he had also free and great entertainment; then to<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_285" id="fnanchor_285"></a><a href="#footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></span>
Vienna, whence he intended to take shipping for Arles;
and being in those parts, was met by<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_286" id="fnanchor_286"></a><a href="#footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></span> the Earl of Provence,
(whose daughter King Henry had married,) and so
hasted to<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></span> the city of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles, there to do his devotions,
and receive the benediction of the monks of that place,
which done he gave them twenty marks; but before he
went thence, there came<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_287" id="fnanchor_287"></a><a href="#footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></span> to him a legate from the Pope
(with the Archbishop of Arles) to inhibite<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></span> him from proceeding
further on his journey, which he took so ill (being
<!--367.png--><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pageno">361</span>
fully resolved thereon, and fitted accordingly), that he
refused<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_288" id="fnanchor_288"></a><a href="#footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></span> both to obey their authority, and to hearken to
their dissuasions. Seeing, therefore, all their endeavours
in vain, they would have persuaded him to take shipping
at the port called the Deadwater, but that he liked not,
and so entered<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_289" id="fnanchor_289"></a><a href="#footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></span> the Mediterranean at Marseilles.</p>

<p>In anno 1241, (25 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) being come into the Holy
Land, he accepted of a truce with the Souldan of Babylon,
upon condition<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_290" id="fnanchor_290"></a><a href="#footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></span> that the French who were prisoners
there might be released, and that Jerusalem, with all the
parts adjacent, should be free from any molestation, as
also upon divers other articles honourable to the Christians.
And the next year following, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 26 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
returned; the king, therefore, having intelligence thereof,
with the queen, met<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_291" id="fnanchor_291"></a><a href="#footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span> him at Dovor.</p>

<p>Soon after which, a Parliament being held at Westminster,
where all the nobles were met, this earl was sent<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_292" id="fnanchor_292"></a><a href="#footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></span>
to them by the king (with the provost of Beverley) to
desire their advice for the recovery of his inheritance in
Normandy and other parts of France. But finding that
the king did not incline to follow the counsel of those who
sought the general honour and good of himself and the
realm, after some sharp dispute with him thereon, he
associated himself with the Earls Marshal, Hereford, and
some others, and took<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_293" id="fnanchor_293"></a><a href="#footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></span> shipping for France.</p>

<p>Before this time, it was, saith<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_294" id="fnanchor_294"></a><a href="#footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></span> my author, that the
king, by the advice of his nobles, having given him the
whole province of Gascoigne, he went thither, and showing
his charter received the homages of that people, and
after some years by another charter had a confirmation of
that grant; but afterwards, when the queen was delivered
of a son, that she so far prevailed with the king as
he should reassume his grant, and give it to the prince,
and that thereupon, this earl grew much displeased, insisting
still upon his right, though he had thus lost the possession.
Moreover, that the king being then in Gascoigne,
and finding the people wavering in their obedience,
not well knowing which way to lean, he did in great wrath
require this earl to resign his grant, and to quit his whole
right thereto. Also, that finding him refractory, he gave
<!--368.png--><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pageno">362</span>
command that the men of Bordeaux should seize upon
him by night and imprison him, which they refused to do,
partly in respect of his birth, and partly by reason they
had done homage to him. And, furthermore, seeing he could
not prevail with them that way, he corrupted some with gifts
to effect his desires, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> to lay hands on him as a rebel, and
cast him in prison; also, that having advertisement thereof
(then lodging in the monastery of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Cross at Bourdeaux)
he got privily on shipboard to come for England, but
without provisions or any necessaries for the journey;
and lastly, (to add to his affliction,) that he was so tossed
with a fearful tempest, as that being in no little peril of
shipwreck, he made a vow to found an abbey for monks of
the Cistercian order, in case he should safe arrive in England.</p>

<p>The next thing memorable of him is, that having taken
another journey to the Holy Land (with William Longespe,
Earl of Salisbury), he returned<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_295" id="fnanchor_295"></a><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span> thence, in anno 1422,
(26 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) and accompanied<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span> the king into Gascoigne,
in aid of Hugh le Brun, Earl of March (who had
married the king’s mother), and was<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span> with him in that
battle near Xant against the King of France; after which,
the next ensuing year, he married<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_296" id="fnanchor_296"></a><a href="#footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></span> Senchia, daughter of
Reymund Earl of Provence, sister to the Queen, the wedding
being kept at Westminster with great pomp, whom
he endowed<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_297" id="fnanchor_297"></a><a href="#footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></span> at the church door with the third part of all
his lands, whereof he then stood possessed, or should
afterwards acquire, the castle and manor of Berkhampstead
being part; and shortly after, keeping his Christmas<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_298" id="fnanchor_298"></a><a href="#footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></span>
at Walingford, entertained the<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></span> king and most of
the nobility there with extraordinary feasting.</p>

<p>In 30 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> the templars and hospitalers electing<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_299" id="fnanchor_299"></a><a href="#footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></span>
many secular persons into their societies for succour of the
Holy Land, and defence of those castles then besieged
there, this earl sent<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></span> them a thousand pounds towards
that good work. And the same year, in accomplishment<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_300" id="fnanchor_300"></a><a href="#footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span>
of his vow formerly made, founded<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span> a Cistercian abbey at
Hales (near Winchcombe, in <abbr title="comitatus Glocester">com. Gloc.</abbr>) causing also the
church of Beaulieu (which his father King John had
<!--369.png--><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pageno">363</span>
founded) to be then dedicated. Moreover, in anno 1247,
(31 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) by authority<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_301" id="fnanchor_301"></a><a href="#footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></span> from the Pope, he gathered<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></span>
vast sums of money from those who were signed with the
cross. And the next year following, through importunity
with the king, obtained<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_302" id="fnanchor_302"></a><a href="#footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span> that no clipt money should be
current.</p>

<p>In anno 1250, (34 Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) passing<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_303" id="fnanchor_303"></a><a href="#footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></span> through France
with a pompous retinue, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr><span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></span> forty knights, all in rich
liveries, five waggons, and fifty sumpter horses, (his lady
and his son Henry being also with him,) the pope being
then at Lyons, sent<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_304" id="fnanchor_304"></a><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span> all his cardinals, except one, besides
a number of clerks, to meet him, and conduct him thither,
and there receiving him with great respect, feasted<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span> him
at his own table. Being returned<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span> from thence in anno
1251, (35 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) on the eve of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leonard, he caused
the Church of Hales to be dedicated<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span> with great solemnity;
which, with extraordinary costs, he had so founded,
as is before observed. And in 36 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> obtained a
grant<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_305" id="fnanchor_305"></a><a href="#footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></span> of the Manor of Ocham in Rutland (sometime belonging
to Isabel de Mortimer), in part of payment of
five hundred pounds due to him from the king, upon the
marriage of Senchia his wife, to hold to himself and the
heirs of his body by her.</p>

<p>Moreover, the next ensuing year, Albert, a clerk, coming<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_306" id="fnanchor_306"></a><a href="#footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></span>
over into England from the Pope, made offer to him
of the kingdom of Apulia, of which he refused<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></span> to accept,
unless he might have some cautionary places of strength,
as also hostages, for securing his possession. And in
38 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> the king then going into Gascoigne he was
joined<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_307" id="fnanchor_307"></a><a href="#footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></span> with the queen in the government here during his
absence, in which year he exacted vast sums of money
from the Jews for the king’s use.</p>

<p>It is observed,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_308" id="fnanchor_308"></a><a href="#footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></span> that in anno 1255, (39 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) upon
a full meeting of the nobles in Parliament at Westminster,
the king specially applied himself to this earl by a formal
speech for a large supply of money, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> forty thousand
pounds, the pope having also written letters to him for
that purpose, signifying that he should therein give a good
example to others; but herein he answered neither of their
expectations. And being a person of high repute for his
<!--370.png--><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a><span class="pageno">364</span>
heroic and noble endowments, about two years after (in
the parliament<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_309" id="fnanchor_309"></a><a href="#footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></span> held at London on the Feast of the Nativity),
certain nobles of Almaine being arrived here, represented<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></span>
to the whole baronage of England then met, that
by unanimous consent of the princes of the empire he
was elected King of the Romans, shewing letters testimonial
for further manifestation thereof; soon after which, the
Archbishop of Cologne, with divers others of the nobles
of that country, came<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_310" id="fnanchor_310"></a><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span> likewise hither, and did homage<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span>
to him; whereupon, he gave<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span> them five hundred marks
towards their travelling expenses, as also a rich mitre,
adorned with precious stones; which so pleased the archbishop,
that he said<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span> thus, as he hath put this mitre on
my head, I will put the crown of Almaine on his.</p>

<p>In order whereunto, taking leave<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span> of his friends on the
third day in Easter week, he committed<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span> himself to the
prayers of the religious, and began his journey towards
Yarmouth, there to take shipping, leaving the charge<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_311" id="fnanchor_311"></a><a href="#footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></span> of
his castles and lands in England to the Bishop of London,
and arriving shortly at Aquisgrave, was there crowned<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_312" id="fnanchor_312"></a><a href="#footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></span>
king upon Ascension day.</p>

<p>Having thus received that great honour, he returned<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_313" id="fnanchor_313"></a><a href="#footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></span>
thence the next year after, and landed<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></span> at Dovor upon
the day of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Julian, where the king met him with much
joy. After this, during his stay here, he made great
preparation for his journey back to receive the crown of
the Empire, which the pope underhand endeavoured<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_314" id="fnanchor_314"></a><a href="#footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></span> to
obtain for him.</p>

<p>But that which I have next observed to be most memorable
of him is, that upon that grand rebellion of those
haughty spirited barons, then headed by Montfort Earl of
Leicester and Clare Earl of Gloucester, he then adhered
stoutly<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_315" id="fnanchor_315"></a><a href="#footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></span> to the king; and in 48 Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> marched
with him to Northampton, where the chief strength of all
their forces at that time were met together, and that he
assisted<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></span> him in the siege and taking of that town, as also
that, pursuing their dissipated forces into Sussex, (where
the Londoners, with all their power recruited them,) he
commanded<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_316" id="fnanchor_316"></a><a href="#footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></span> the body of the king’s army in that fatal
battle of Lewes, where he shared with him in the unhappy
<!--371.png--><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pageno">365</span>
success of that day, being there taken prisoner. Lastly,
that (in anno 1267, 51 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) he went<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_317" id="fnanchor_317"></a><a href="#footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></span> again into
Germany, and there married<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></span> Beatrix, niece to the Archbishop
of Cologne. And in 55 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> was made<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_318" id="fnanchor_318"></a><a href="#footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></span>
Governor of Rockingham Castle, in <abbr title="comitatus">com.</abbr> Northampton,
and Warden of the Forest.</p>

<p>Having thus done with the chief of his secular actings
and employments, I now come to his works of piety.</p>

<p>Besides his foundation of the Abbey of Hales (whereof
I have already made mention) he likewise founded<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_319" id="fnanchor_319"></a><a href="#footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></span> that of
Rewley (of the same order) in the suburbs of Oxford; and
moreover granted<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_320" id="fnanchor_320"></a><a href="#footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></span> to the monks of Bec, in Normandy,
that all their tenants within the precincts of the honour of
Walingford should be exempted from suit of court to that
honour, provided that his bailiff of Walingford should
every year keep a court leet for the manor of Okebourne
within the bounds of the priory there (which was a
cell to Bec), to see that the king’s peace should be duly
kept, and that the benefit arising by that leet should
redound to those monks of Okebourne, they entertaining
the bailiff of Walingford with three or four horse of his
retinue at their charge for that day.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he gave<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_321" id="fnanchor_321"></a><a href="#footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></span> to the canons of the Holy
Trinity at Knaresburgh, for the health of his soul and the
souls of his ancestors, the chapel of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Robert at Knaresburgh,
with the advowson of the church at Hamstwait,
confirming all those grants which King John had given
thereto, with divers other lands of great extent. And to
the monks of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount in Cornwall, gave<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_322" id="fnanchor_322"></a><a href="#footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></span> ten
shillings rent due to him for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James Fair, kept yearly
near to the Mount.</p>

<p>Having thus acted a long part on the theatre of this
world with great honour, after a tedious sickness<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_323" id="fnanchor_323"></a><a href="#footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></span> at his
manor of Berkhampstead, in <abbr title="comitatus">com.</abbr> Herts, he died<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_324" id="fnanchor_324"></a><a href="#footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></span> upon
the fourth of the nones of April, anno 1172 (56 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>)
whereupon his heart was buried<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_325" id="fnanchor_325"></a><a href="#footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></span> in the Gray Friars at
Oxford, under a sumptuous pyramid, and his body<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></span> in
the Abbey of Hales, so founded by him as before hath
been observed.</p>

<p><!--372.png--><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pageno">366</span>
By his first wife Roese de Dovor, he had no issue, she
taking another husband, as it seems, when she arrived to
years of consent.</p>

<p>By Isabel the second (widow of Gilbert de Clare, Earl
of Gloucester), he had issue four sons, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> John,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_326" id="fnanchor_326"></a><a href="#footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></span> Henry,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></span>
Richard, and Nicholas,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_327" id="fnanchor_327"></a><a href="#footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></span> (of which Henry I shall say more
by and by), John and Richard departing this life in their
infancy, and Nicholas, with his mother, in<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_328" id="fnanchor_328"></a><a href="#footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></span> childbed.
Also a daughter, who dying<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_329" id="fnanchor_329"></a><a href="#footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></span> in her cradle, was buried<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></span>
near unto John her brother at Reading.</p>

<p>By Senchia, the third wife (daughter to Raymund Earl of
Provence), he had issue Richard, who died<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></span> young, and
Edmund,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></span> who succeeded him in his Earldom of Cornwall;
but by Beatrix,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_330" id="fnanchor_330"></a><a href="#footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></span> the fourth wife, (niece to the Archbishop
of Cologne,) he had no issue.</p>

<p>It is said<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_331" id="fnanchor_331"></a><a href="#footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></span> that he had an illegitimate daughter called
Isabel, who became the wife<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></span> of Maurice Lord Berkeley,
and to whom King Henry the Third (calling her his niece),
for her better support, in the forty-eighth of his reign,
gave the manors of Herotesham and Trotesclive in Kent.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_332" id="fnanchor_332"></a><a href="#footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></span>
There is also this epitaph recorded<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_333" id="fnanchor_333"></a><a href="#footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></span> for him.</p>

<p>Of his two sons, I shall first speak of Henry.</p>

<p>This <span class="sc">Henry</span>, in anno 1257 (41 Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) was<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_334" id="fnanchor_334"></a><a href="#footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></span> knighted
by Richard King of Almaine, his father, upon the day of
his coronation at Aquisgrave in Germany.</p>

<p><!--373.png--><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pageno">367</span>
It is said that in 47 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> having been through
plausible and specious pretences seduced by Montfort
Earl of Leicester, and some other of the rebellious barons,
he was taken off by Prince Edward for the honour of
Tikhill, which he then gave<span class="lock"><sup>[335]</sup></span> him; and the same year
received<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_336" id="fnanchor_336"></a><a href="#footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></span> one hundred marks, assigned to him out of the
issues of the county of Dorset, by the king’s appointment,
to fortify the castles of Corff and Shireborne. But notwithstanding
this, it seems that he inclined to them again
for the next year following, (<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 48 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) upon the
march of Montfort and his party into the counties of
Gloucester, Worcester, Salop, and then southwards. This
Henry favouring them, was taken by some of the king’s
soldiers. Howbeit, shortly after, the king holding a Parliament
at London, amongst those who fell off from that
rebellious pack he was<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_338" id="fnanchor_338"></a><a href="#footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></span> one, and thenceforth stuck
stoutly to the king, marching<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_339" id="fnanchor_339"></a><a href="#footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></span> with him to Northampton,
where the chief of their strength being then got together,
after a sharp dispute were vanquished.<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, in the battle of Lewes, he was<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_340" id="fnanchor_340"></a><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span> one of the
principal commanders in the body of the king’s army, at
that time led by Richard King of Almaine his father; and
after that fatal overthrow there (through the assistance of
the Londoners, who poured out all the strength they
could make to their aid), seeing the king and divers of the
nobles made prisoners,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span> he joined with Prince Edward in
mediating a fair reconciliation betwixt both parties; and,
in order thereto, the next day following put himself into
the hands of Montfort, and the rest.</p>

<p>But after this I have not observed anything else further
memorable of him, other than that in 56 Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> being<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span>
with Prince Edward on his way towards the Holy Land,
and partly weary<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span> of the length of the journey, and partly
desirous<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span> to see his father before he died, having leave<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span>
he came<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span> into Italy, and at Viterbium was<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span> basely murdered
by Guy one of the sons to Montfort, Earl of Leicester,
within the church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Laurence, at high mass,
in revenge of his father’s death, who had been slain in the
battle of Evesham, about seven years before, as I have
elsewhere fully manifested.</p>

<p><!--374.png--><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pageno">368</span>
I now come to <span class="sc">Edmund</span>, who, surviving his father, succeeded
him in the dignity of Earl.</p>

<p class="p2 center">EDMUND EARL OF CORNWALL.</p>

<p>In 42 Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> this Edmund being possessed of the
honour of Eye, (his father then living,) upon levying the
scutage of Wales, paid one hundred and eighty pounds
for ninety knights’ fees and an half belonging thereto.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_341" id="fnanchor_341"></a><a href="#footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></span>
And in anno 1266, (51 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) obtained<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_342" id="fnanchor_342"></a><a href="#footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></span> of a certain
nobleman, lord of Seyland, a large proportion of the blood
of Christ, which he deposited in the abbey of Hales (so
founded by his father as aforesaid.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, in 55 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> accomplishing<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_343" id="fnanchor_343"></a><a href="#footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></span> his full
age of twenty-one years, he received<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_344" id="fnanchor_344"></a><a href="#footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></span> the honour of
knighthood, upon <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edward’s Day, and soon after that
was invested with the title of Earl of this county by cincture
with the sword; before the end of which year he
likewise married<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></span> Margaret the sister of Gilbert de Clare,
Earl of Gloucester, and shortly after had livery of the
castles of Knaresburgh, Walingford, Okham, and Berkhamstead,
of his inheritance.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_345" id="fnanchor_345"></a><a href="#footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, in 13 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> he obtained a charter<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_346" id="fnanchor_346"></a><a href="#footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></span> for a
weekly market every Friday at his manor of Cosham in
<abbr title="comitatus">com.</abbr> Wilts; and the same year had another<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_347" id="fnanchor_347"></a><a href="#footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></span> for free
warren in his lordship of Great Cestreton, and Little
Cestreton, in <abbr title="comitatus">com.</abbr> Oxon, as also for free chase<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_348" id="fnanchor_348"></a><a href="#footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></span> in his lands
of Wasseley and Wymbureholt.</p>

<p>In 15 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> he had a grant of<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_349" id="fnanchor_349"></a><a href="#footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></span> the castle of Ockham,
to hold in fee with the sheriffalty of the county of Rutland.
And in 16 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> being made warden of England
during the king’s absence (in the wars of Scotland),
marched into Wales, and laid siege to Droselan Castle,
the walls whereof he demolished.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_350" id="fnanchor_350"></a><a href="#footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></span> Furthermore, in
17 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> he was constituted sheriff<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_351" id="fnanchor_351"></a><a href="#footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></span> for the county of
Cornwall in fee. And in 25 <abbr title="Edward One">Edw. I.</abbr> obtained the king’s
precept<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_352" id="fnanchor_352"></a><a href="#footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></span> to the barons of his Exchequer, that they should
not exact more from him for the honour and castle of
<!--375.png--><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pageno">369</span>
Walingford, then the service of three knights’ fees, by
which it had been granted<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_353" id="fnanchor_353"></a><a href="#footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></span> to his father and his heirs in
15 <abbr title="Henry">Hen.</abbr> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></p>

<p>This Edmund founded<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_354" id="fnanchor_354"></a><a href="#footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></span> a certain college at Asherugge,
in co. Bucks, in honour of the blood of our Saviour, for
certain brethren called Bonhomes; and for the soul of

<p class="p2 center">THE HUNDREDS OF CORNWALL.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Prefixed</span> to Tonkin’s <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> of the Parochial History of
Cornwall (with additions in notes by J. Whitaker) are
the following notes:</p>

<p>Mem. Mr. Hawkins tells me that there is a camp
near Trutheun, in Bishop’s Wood, not large.</p>

<p>Carew (Edition 1769) <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 30. The Cornish “pay in
most places onely <em>fee Morton</em> releeses, which is after five
markes the whole knight’s fee (so called of John, Earle
first of Morton, then of Cornwall, and lastly King of this
land); whereas, that of <em>fee Gloucester</em> is five pounds.”</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> is in the possession of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Pye,
Rector of Truro, and had been recovered by him from
imminent destruction, as he told me, at a house formerly
belonging to Mr. Tonkin, and then inhabited by Mr. Fortescue.
A <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> in folio, and another in quarto, had
been left in a cupboard of the kitchen, and applied to culinary
purposes. Mr. Pye’s attention was arrested by
seeing part of the quarto wrapping round some plumb
cake; he therefore begged the rest. And he found the
Folio had been used entirely, and the quarto up to the
letter P. and page 406. With this account he made me
(as I thought) a present of the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> I therefore wrote
some additions of my own upon the blank places of it.
He afterwards desired me (as I thought) to lend it him
awhile. But when I sent for it back again, he denied he
had ever meant to give it me; and I thought myself
obliged in honour to waive all claim to the property, and
to borrow it for transcription. But I then erased my

very many others.</p>

<p class="p2 center">THE HUNDREDS OF CORNWALL.</p>

<p class="p2 center small"><span class="sc">LES-NEWITH.</span> New Court. (Dr. Pryce).</p>

<p>I notice this first, because it points out the scope and
drift of the other names. It is so called from the Court of
the Hundred, Les-Newydh (C.) New Court, as being a
new Hundred, and this new Court giving name to the
place at which it was kept, near Tintagel.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">STRATTON.</p>

<p>So called from Stratton, the seat of its Court, and
therefore the head of the hundred. The hill full of fresh
springs of waters (Dr. Pryce).</p>

<p class="p2 center small">POWDRE.</p>

<p>So called from the Court House (I apprehend) called
(I suppose) Pou Dre (C.) the house of the province. Pou
Dar, the borough, country, or hundred of Oaks. (Dr.
Pryce.)</p>

<p class="p2 center small">PIDRE.</p>

<p>Called from its house near the four burrows, which has
alwas given name to the street in Truro, leading towards
it, as the house was so called from its being at the four
burrows, Pidyr Carnon perhaps. The fourth hundred.
(Dr. Pryce.)</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TRIG.</p>

<p>From its house called Trig (C.) a dwelling, and situate
at the ebb of the sea, or on the sea shore. (Dr. Pryce.)</p>

<p class="p2 center small">EAST AND WEST.</p>

<p>Hundreds, formed by the English since the Conquest
of Cornwall, and so named by them from the relative
situation of their respective Court Houses.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">
<!--383.png--><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pageno">377</span>
KERRIER.</p>

<p>From Curhar (C.) I believe a jail, a prison; the Court
House of the Hundred, I apprehend, having always a prison
a jail for it.</p>

<p>The coast or border of the country, Kur-Urian (Dr.
Pryce); which signify, even in Dr. Pryce himself, Kur, the
coast or border of a country, and, Urian, the border,
boundary, or limit of a country: so that Kerrier, thus
explained, is the same thing doubly.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">PENWITH.</p>

<p>The head of the breach or separation, as the Land’s
End is from Scilly. (Dr. Pryce.)</p>

<p>From its Court House, on the promontory, called Penwith
or Land’s End; and this promontory, so called as
Dr. Pryce thinks from Pen, and With the head of the
separation from Scilly; but rather as With (says Nennius)
signifies Divortium, and means the Isle of Wight, the
headland of the Isle opposite, just as this very promontory
was called by the ancients Anti Vesteeum, the point
opposed to Vesteeum.</p>

<p class="p2 center">EPITAPH OF RICHARD CAREW, OF ANTONY, <abbr title="Esquire">ESQ.</abbr></p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> circumstances under which it has happened that no
correct copy has hitherto been printed of the epitaph of Carew,
in the church of Antony, are remarkable. The learned Camden
was solicited to supply it originally, as is shown by his
Epistolæ, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 106; but Richard Carew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> the son of the
deceased, appears to have preferred a more circumstantial
composition, at the same time that he retained several of Camden’s
expressions. Hugh C &mdash;&mdash;, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who wrote the Life of
the Historian prefixed to the Survey of Cornwall, quoted the
epitaph, not from the monument, but from Camden’s Epistolæ;
and he was followed by Mr. Polwhele and Mr. Lysons, under
the impression that it was the actual inscription on the tomb,
nor was the deficiency supplied in the handsome reprint of
Carew’s Survey by Lord de Dunstanville. It is believed that
Mr. C. S. Gilbert was the first to copy it, but very inaccurately,
in his Historical Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="two">ii</abbr>, 388; and the first
perfect copy is the present.</p>

<p>“The verses following were written by Richard Carew, of
Antony, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> immediately before his death (which happened
the sixth of November 1620) as he was at his private
prayers in his study (his daily practice) at four in the afternoon;
and being found in his pocket, were preserved by
his grandson Sir Alexander Carew, according to whose
desire they are here set up in memory of him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h4 class="h4head">Transcriber’s Note:</h4>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words and names had not
become standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple
spelling variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These
have been left unchanged. Dialect, obsolete and alternative spellings
were left unchanged, as were misspelled words, incorrect use of
homonyms, and sentences without verbs. The book used hyphens, dots, and
spaces of various lengths to indicate unknown names, dates or words.
For consistency, these were changed to long dashes: &mdash;&mdash;. Insular
letters were replaced with contemporary equivalents. In Appendix XI,
abbreviations are sometimes indicated with a macron or tilde above or
through one or more letters. These are shown within brackets, e.g.
[=m] and [~co].</p>

<p>Obvious printing errors, such as backwards, upside down, missing or
partially printed letters, were corrected. Unprinted punctuation and
final stops missing at the end of abbreviations and sentences were
added. Duplicated words were removed, as were duplicate letters after
rejoining words that were hyphenated at the end of a line. Excess spaces
in abbreviations of titles, D.D. and M.D., were removed.</p>

<p>Footnotes were numbered sequentially and moved to the end of the
section in which the anchors occur. Footnotes [139] and [335] are
missing in the original; there are no anchors for footnotes <span class="lock"><a
href="#footnote_227">[227]</a></span>, <span class="lock"><a
href="#footnote_230">[230]</a></span>, and <span class="lock"><a
href="#footnote_337">[337]</a></span>. In Appendix XII, many footnotes have multiple
anchors; each footnote is linked to the first anchor.</p>

<p>The following were added, changed, or noted:</p>

<ul>
<li>The inscription in Greek on page <a href="#Page_37">37</a> may be missing a word at the
end of the first line (Βαθύλλου); gamma was substituted for
upside-down lambda in line 5.</li>

<li>On page <a href="#Page_193">193</a> in Appendix V, there is no subparagraph 3.</li>

<li>On page <a href="#Page_362">362</a>, “1422” should read “1242”.</li>

<li>Page numbers missing in <a href="#Page_319">Appendix X</a> are also missing in the original
of Tanner’s Notitia monastica.</li>

<li>The list of errata at the end of the book appears only in Volume 1; it
was added for the convenience of readers. Links are provided only to items
in this volume.</li>
</ul>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
